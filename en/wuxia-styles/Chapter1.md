# **Xiangyang, 1356**

## *Shadows of Discord*

Zhou Zhiruo cried out in anger, "Despicable fiends\! Was I wrong? Zhang Shicheng himself was indeed driven out of Hangzhou, but now Shaoxing falls to Fang Guozhen\! You all neglected the river in Hangzhou, flowing from Zhejiang to the coast. Fang Guozhen must have breached it through there. Now they control a long stretch from Shaoxing to Qingyuan, is this not the same as dominating the eastern seaboard? Zhang Shicheng himself occupies Suzhou, but colluding with Fang Guozhen, they now rule the eastern lands. In other words, Jiangnan now belongs to Zhang Shicheng\!"

But Zhang Wuji's attention was fixed on another matter. He inquired, "Is Zhang Shide truly Zhang Shicheng's own brother?"

"Indeed," Fan Yao confirmed. "His other two younger brothers also lead troops — Zhang Shiyi and Zhang Shixin — but Zhang Shide is the appointed grand commander."

"Hm\!" Zhang Wuji mused deeply, then declared, "In that case, have Zhu Yuanzhang keep a close watch on Zhang Shide. If the opportunity arises, capture him\! Has not Han Lin'er already appointed Zhu Yuanzhang as the Regional Commander of Jiangnan? With that, we have a chance to parley with Zhang Shicheng without resorting to war\!"

"A brilliant idea\!" Fan Yao exclaimed. "I shall dispatch Hu Zhanglao to Hangzhou at once\!"

Amidst the tension with Zhang Shicheng, they received news that Toqto'a had perished in Yunnan, most likely poisoned by assassins sent by Hama.

"Alas, what a pity," Zhao Min lamented. Toqto'a was one of her admired statesmen. "The Yuan Dynasty will surely descend into utter chaos after this."

Not long after, they heard that Guo Tianyou — younger brother of Guo Tianxu — whom Han Lin'er had appointed as Zhu Yuanzhang's deputy, had passed away. There was no word from Ma Xiuying regarding this. Zhou Zhiruo murmured, "This seems highly suspicious. Why are all of Zhu Yuanzhang's rivals suddenly dying?"

"You are being overly suspicious," Zhang Wuji countered. "People can still die from illness. A plague is currently ravaging the region; it is entirely possible that Guo Tianyou died of natural causes."

While they were grappling with the situation with Zhang Shicheng, Peng Yingyu reported that Ni Wenjun was currently attacking Hanyang.

"Alas," Zhang Wuji sighed. He knew that they had previously conquered Hanyang, but Zou Pusheng had failed to hold it for long. Now, Xu Shouhui intended to reclaim it; of course, he would not interfere, but placing Chen Youliang in command would undoubtedly embolden the man. Regardless of the battle's outcome, Chen Youliang would ultimately control the troops under his command.

Zhang Wuji could see Zhao Min's prediction drawing closer to reality. This was but the first step; after this, if Zhao Min was correct, Chen Youliang would seek to assassinate Ni Wenjun. For a moment, he was at a loss, and glanced towards Zhao Min.

Zhao Min stated, "If Xu Shouhui is no longer willing to heed your counsel, then I also do not know what to do. Even if we attempt to infiltrate members of the Five Element Banners into Xu Shouhui's army, I highly doubt they will be able to sway the soldiers of Ni Wenjun who are under Chen Youliang's command. All soldiers must obey their commander, and their commander is currently Chen Youliang, not one of us. The only solution is to remove Chen Youliang from his command, but if he proves himself to be a capable leader, then our actions would be unjustified."

Zhang Wuji felt that Zhao Min's assessment was entirely in line with Yang Xiao's thinking. And it seemed this was precisely what Xu Shouhui saw, which was why Xu Shouhui disregarded Peng Yingyu's advice.

While dining with Wei Yixiao, who had just arrived from Hangzhou, they overheard the people there singing praises of Commander Chen's battlefield prowess. They believed that, if things continued in this manner, Xu Shouhui would soon be able to retake the cities of Hanyang, Hankou, and Wuchang from the Yuan Dynasty.

They were then celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, dining at a tavern on the outskirts of the city. A group of scholars drinking wine not far from them were discussing Zhu Yuanzhang's forces having captured Yingtian, and Zhu Yuanzhang's appointment as regional governor. They seemed to be engaged in a heated debate. One scholar in his thirties, who seemed to adhere strongly to the teachings of Neo-Confucianism, clicked his tongue in displeasure and said, "What is so great about that? A man who murders his own brother-in-law is appointed governor; soon, he will murder his superior as well\! If I were the emperor, I would have such a man removed from my ranks immediately\!"

"Guo Zixing had his reasons for marrying his daughter to him," said another, a handsome man slightly younger than the first. "Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou were jealous of this from the start. They also wanted to marry Lady Ma at the time. So, Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice but to kill him\!"

Another young man, plump with a broad, round face, defended the handsome man, adding, "Besides, it is said that the Ming Cult Leader pardoned him. How dare you contradict the Ming Cult Leader?"

The first man became even more agitated. He said sharply, "Zhang Wuji is no good either\! Abandoning his own wedding in Hangzhou, and you praise such a man?" He spat on the floor, then continued, "That man has known Zhu Yuanzhang since he was a monk; of course, he would defend him\! Just imagine, a monk, and now I hear he has taken several concubines\! And he just had a child\! But I am not surprised; their Ming Cult Leader himself is said to have raped a princess, and now the Widow of Emei is his concubine\! Immoral men beget immoral followers\!"

At that moment, Wei Yixiao was half-dead trying to suppress his laughter. He secretly glanced at Zhang Wuji, Zhou Zhiruo, and Zhao Min. But Zhao Min seemed as composed as ever. A faint smile played on the corner of her lips, though she was not truly smiling. Zhang Wuji poured the newly arrived wine into his cup, then drained it in one gulp. Wei Yixiao could not fathom what Zhou Zhiruo was thinking. The girl appeared indifferent, her beautiful face colder than usual.

The plump young man hurriedly warned his companion, "Hey, watch your tongue\! If there are any members of the Ming Cult around here, your head could be separated from your neck. I hear Wei Yixiao is particularly fond of human necks."

But another young man with a robust build declared, "People always exaggerate. How could such a thing be? If Wei Yixiao were here right now, I would stuff my shoe into his mouth\!"

The first man laughed heartily, then gave him a thumbs-up, saying, "A true man fears not death\!"

Wei Yixiao intended to move to teach the two men he considered insolent a lesson, but Zhang Wuji held his arm and shook his head.

"You two are truly reckless," said another scholar, roughly the same age as the first. "I hear Wei Yixiao can move as fast as the wind, and the Ming Cult Leader rendered Miejue Shitai helpless. The Yitian Sword was utterly useless in her hands. You all know that once the Yitian Sword is drawn, it must taste human blood before it will return to its scabbard. But Zhang Wuji simply took it away."

"In that case, that Vicious Nun must also be enamored with that Little Lecher\!" said the robust young man. He laughed boisterously as he downed his wine. "Don't we all know that Little Lecher possesses magical powers?"

"But that Little Lecher almost died at the hands of the beautiful Emei Widow," said the first man. "Where are these magical powers you speak of?"

The robust young man chuckled. "Then, the Beautiful Emei Widow's magical powers must be superior," he said.

"Well, the proof is that she is now that Little Lecher's concubine\!" the first scholar concluded.

They all burst into laughter. But moments later, the first scholar and the robust young man abruptly stopped laughing, their mouths snapping shut. The next instant, their companions stared in horror, pointing at them.

"Your mouths..." said another young man who had been silent all along.

"Why are your mouths bleeding?" asked the handsome young man.

In a panic, the first scholar and his robust friend tried to vomit something they seemed to have swallowed. But only blood came from their mouths. Their companions saw that one of their front teeth was broken. The broken pieces had probably been swallowed and could not be regurgitated. No one knew how their teeth had been broken while they were laughing.

The group of young scholars then whispered amongst themselves in terror, left some silver on the table to pay for their drinks, and hurriedly fled the tavern.

No one knew, except for Wei Yixiao, Zhang Wuji, and Zhao Min, that while they were laughing uproariously, Zhou Zhiruo had taken two peanuts from Zhao Min's hand and flicked them towards the first commenting scholar and the robust scholar. The peanuts shattered their front teeth, and the broken pieces, along with the peanuts, went straight into their throats. The action was so swift that Zhang Wuji did not even have time to stop Zhou Zhiruo.

The waiter who brought their ordered food arrived at their table almost simultaneously with the group of scholars' hasty departure. He was completely unaware of what had happened and only muttered in confusion, "Eh, there's still so much wine left, why did they suddenly leave?"

After the waiter left, Zhou Zhiruo picked up a piece of bakpao, tore off a small portion, and began to chew slowly and leisurely. Her face remained as cold as before.

Zhao Min took the Mongolian flatbread she had ordered, along with roasted mutton and a small bowl of cheese. In that era, cheese and yogurt had become popular in Zhongyuan since the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty. The bread was hollow in the center, and Zhao Min tore off the edges, then filled the center with the mutton, cheese, and scrambled eggs. Next, she added a generous amount of sliced red chili peppers and onions, then began to bite into the bread. She said to Zhou Zhiruo, "Zhou Jiejie, this tavern serves my favorite food. Would you like to try some?"

"That sounds like a good idea," Zhou Zhiruo replied, taking a fresh bakpao and tearing it open in the middle. "The meat would go well with the bakpao. Please pass me some of that cheese, but not too much chili." She smiled, seemingly having completely forgotten the incident moments ago.

Wei Yixiao was still stunned after witnessing Zhou Zhiruo's demonstration. He only snapped out of his daze when Zhou Zhiruo asked, "So, the rumors about Zhu Yuanzhang's concubines are true?" Zhao Min asked with a smile. "And Shuobude Dashi approves of it as well?"

"Concubines?" Wei Yixiao repeated, puzzled. A moment later, he realized what Zhao Min was referring to. "Oh, Shuobude has not reported anything about that." He cleared his throat and glanced at Zhang Wuji.

While they continued their conversation over food, a tall, burly man entered and approached their table, addressing Zhao Min directly, "Xiaojie!"

Zhang Wuji, Wei Yixiao, and Zhou Zhiruo were briefly surprised, but then they recognized the man as one of the Eight Divine Arrows trained by Zhao Min, now dressed in Han-style clothing, without any Mongolian attire. He also addressed Zhao Min as 'Xiaojie', rather than 'Junzhu' as usual, which was why they did not recognize him.

“What is it?” Zhao Min asked, her eyes sharp. “How did you know I was here?”

Qian Erbai, one of the Eight Divine Arrows, replied, “Gongzi left a message, urging Xiaojie not to tarry in Hanyang. Gongzi fears it will bring calamity upon Laoye.”

Zhao Min nodded, understanding. Wang Baobao wished to avoid a confrontation between her and Bolad Temur, who was currently within Xu Shouhui’s territory. Especially given her presence with Zhang Wuji.

“I understand,” she said. “Where is Laoye at this moment?”

Qian Erbai hesitated, glancing at Zhang Wuji and Wei Yixiao.

Finally, Zhao Min said, “Very well, I comprehend. Tell Gongzi, he should focus on our greater enemies, rather than meddling in my affairs! I am no child; I know how to protect myself!”

After a respectful bow, Qian Erbai departed.

Zhao Min beckoned them closer, whispering, “My father is not here, but he knows we have come, and has presented us with an opportunity to eliminate Bolad Temur — or his son.”

“How do you know?” Zhang Wuji inquired.

“It is quite simple,” Zhao Min replied, a faint smile playing on her lips. “Bolad Temur is my father’s sworn enemy. If he were here, my father would dispatch a token force to aid him, merely to obey the central court’s command, but he himself would withdraw, feigning preoccupation.” Her cheeks flushed slightly, and she continued, “That man once sent emissaries to propose me as a concubine for his son, but my father flatly refused.”

Zhou Zhiruo chuckled softly. “Meizi, had Han Lin’er made such a proposal, perhaps your father would have accepted.”

Zhao Min almost retorted, “I have no desire to compete with you,” but she restrained herself. Their relationship was currently amicable. Instead, she said, “Han Lin’er would not wed a Junzhu.”

Zhou Zhiruo said, “Wei Fuwang, I must request your assistance in delivering this letter to Ma Furen, if Zhang Jiaozhu has no objection.”

She handed over a small pouch containing the letter Zhao Min had written, then produced a smaller, unwrapped slip of paper from her sleeve. “This contains the true message. I trust Wei Fuwang’s skill; he will surely slip this message into Ma Furen’s hand, immediately after she receives the pouch.”

Zhang Wuji and Wei Yixiao read the contents of both letters, and smiled wryly. “You two are quite cunning,” Zhang Wuji said. “One contains recipes for cakes and roasted duck, while the other holds lengthy information concerning another's affairs. Is this not somewhat excessive?”

Zhao Min smiled broadly. “We merely seek to cultivate good relations with Ma Xiuying. And have we not heard of those women? Ma Xiuying will value this greatly. Next time, should she possess more crucial information, we shall surely be informed.”

“For matters such as these, Miss Zhou and Miss Zhao can surely rely on Zaixia,” Wei Yixiao declared with glee. He recalled his past exploits, such as snatching Consort Han from Chaghan Temur’s palace and delivering her to Lu Zhangke's chambers, a testament to his skill in stealth and message delivery.

Zhou Zhiruo stated, “Wuji Gege, these are matters of women; you need not delve too deeply. Trust that you will be most grateful to Ma Xiuying in time.”

Remembering his grandmaster’s counsel to strengthen ties with Ma Xiuying, Zhang Wuji conceded, “Very well, but henceforth, I must be privy to the nature of the messages you send.”

The two maidens readily agreed, their eyes gleaming with shared purpose.

That very night, Wei Yixiao departed eastward to deliver the messages. Zhang Wuji also penned letters to Peng Yingyu, Liu Futong, and Yang Xiao, entrusting them to Wei Yixiao’s swift hands. Zhang Wuji, Zhou Zhiruo, and Zhao Min then strolled through Xiangyang’s night streets, absorbing the city’s nocturnal ambiance. Along their path, Zhang Wuji imparted instructions to Zhao Min on the proper cultivation of her breath, adhering to the teachings of the Jiu Yang Shen Gong. As Zhou Zhiruo had already mastered the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing, he offered only pertinent comments when she inquired.

Zhao Min swiftly grasped the essence of his lengthy explanations, and from that night forward, she diligently meditated and practiced her breathing, following Zhang Wuji’s guidance.

Shortly thereafter, Peng Yingyu relayed news that Ni Wenjun had relocated the dynasty’s capital to Hanyang, which he had recently seized. Upon reading this, Zhang Wuji felt a deep unease. He perceived this move as the harbinger of rebellion.

They returned to the inn in silence, each lost in their own thoughts. At a bend in the road, a contingent of Yuan Dynasty cavalry, fully armed, materialized and swiftly encircled them. A general, in his thirties, stepped forward and proclaimed loudly, “Zhang Wuji, you are surrounded! Surrender, and I shall spare your life!”

“That is Zhang Liangbi,” Zhao Min whispered.

They observed that the cavalry numbered around a hundred, with likely more concealed nearby. Seeing this, Zhao Min’s mind raced, and she stepped forward, her voice sweet, “Zhang Daren, do you also seek to slay me?”

“Shaomin Junzhu,” Zhang Liangbi replied with a smile. “Of course not. But you keep the wrong company. This is not only ill-advised for you, but it also endangers your father. I suggest you return with me, and I shall hasten our nuptials.”

Zhao Min bestowed her most captivating smile. “Daren,” she said softly. “I believe you are aware that I have been disowned by my father for rebellion. Do you not fear taking me as a concubine?”

Zhang Liangbi eagerly urged his horse forward, believing Zhao Min had no recourse. He was confident he could dispose of the young rebel after she agreed to his proposal.

However, unexpectedly, as he emerged from his tightly packed ranks, several small pebbles flew with the speed of wind, unseen by him. Instantly, his hands and feet tingled, rendering him immobile. As he attempted to shout, another pebble struck, silencing him.

Zhang Wuji, hearing the subtle sound of Zhou Zhiruo’s flicked pebbles, immediately understood what had transpired. With swiftness, he leaped toward Zhang Liangbi’s horse, seizing the man’s armor at the chest. Using the horse’s head as a springboard, he returned to his original position, carrying the general with him. All this occurred in mere seconds. By the time the soldiers realized what had happened, Zhang Liangbi was in Zhang Wuji’s grasp, and Zhou Zhiruo’s sword was at his throat.

Zhao Min smiled, a hint of playful malice in her eyes, and said, “Since Daren is unwilling to speak, perhaps I shall begin?”

Zhang Liangbi seethed with rage, yet he was rendered mute, his limbs paralyzed. He could only widen his eyes and signal with nods and shakes. His soldiers, bows and arrows drawn, stood poised to strike Zhang Wuji, Zhao Min, and Zhou Zhiruo, but dared not move without his command.

In that tense moment, more Yuan soldiers emerged from the rooftops, arrows aimed, adding to the suffocating encirclement.

Zhao Min inwardly cursed. If Zhang Liangbi were harmed or killed, a storm of arrows would rain down upon them. Even if he ordered a cease-fire, their escape would be thwarted by another wave of soldiers blocking all exits.

The city fell into an eerie silence. Shops and entertainment venues hastily shuttered their doors and windows, and the streets emptied.

Suddenly, a lone rider emerged from the distance, his voice ringing out, “Yuan soldiers, surrender! Your supplies in Hanyang, Hankou, and Wuchang are consumed by fire. We offer you passage, abide by the laws of war, and leave the city’s populace unharmed. Should you persist, behold what lies behind you!”

As the horse drew closer, they recognized the rider, clad in rags like a beggar, with eight pouches slung across his back. When the Yuan soldiers turned, they saw, twenty meters behind them, a contingent of beggars, bows and arrows ready. Further back, a multitude of torches flared, accompanied by the clatter of weapons.

The Eight-Pouch Elder of the Beggars’ Sect, Sima Han, had been dispatched to aid Zhang Wuji in Xiangyang. Hearing of Zhang Wuji’s arrival from Wei Yixiao, they had intended to meet him at the inn. However, they witnessed Chen Youliang’s forces moving towards the Yuan encampment in Hanyang, and shortly after, Zhang Liangbi emerged with a mere five hundred men. They swiftly sent scouts to monitor Chen Youliang’s movements and gathered more members to encircle Zhang Liangbi’s forces from behind.

Witnessing the tense standoff, Sima Han initially felt a surge of panic. But then, his scouts returned with news that Chen Youliang had successfully burned the Yuan encampment. Emboldened, Sima Han ordered the Beggars’ Sect members to encircle the Yuan soldiers who were surrounding Zhang Wuji.

Realizing their strategic advantage, Zhang Wuji released Zhang Liangbi and his men. The Yuan soldiers, aware of their encirclement by Ni Wenjun’s forces led by Chen Youliang, retreated from Hubei.

The following day, the city erupted in celebration, hailing the Ming Cult, the Beggars’ Sect, and Ni Wenjun’s and Chen Youliang’s armies. Small groups, with drums and trumpets, paraded into Hanyang, continuing the festivities.

Observing this, Zhang Wuji knew that Ni Wenjun’s desire to relocate the Tianwan capital to Hanyang was now unstoppable, fueled by popular support.

Unbeknownst to Zhang Liangbi, the Beggars’ Sect members numbered only three hundred, but they brandished numerous torches, creating the illusion of a much larger force.


****************

Meanwhile, in Dadu, Qi Shengniang brooded alone in her private chambers. She had made a perilous gamble, allowing Hama to strip Toqto'a of his authority. Toqto'a’s policies, though intended to avert famine, had ignited inflation and rebellions in the south and Goryeo. Zhang Shicheng, with his blockade of food supplies to the capital, further exacerbated the crisis, bringing hunger to Dadu’s gates.

Hama, driven by ambition, sought to manipulate Qi Shengniang's son, Ayushiridara, to usurp the throne. Qi Shengniang, with a heavy heart, sacrificed Toqto'a to safeguard her son. Yet, she was acutely aware of the danger Hama posed to Toqto'a, who might employ martial experts to eliminate him.

Qi Shengniang penned a lengthy letter, folded it into a minuscule size, and encased it within a wax pill. She summoned her trusted eunuch, “Bul-hwa, hasten this letter to Henan!”

Within the letter, Qi Shengniang warned Toqto'a of the impending peril and offered guidance for his escape. She also alluded to Liu Bowen, a strategist dispatched to aid Toqto'a, noting his lack of martial prowess against skilled fighters.

Qi Shengniang included an added caution to Toqto'a, urging him to be exceedingly vigilant, as Hama was likely to dispatch martial artists to assassinate him. She harbored deep anxiety for Toqto'a’s safety.

******************

After Chaghan Temur struck Zhao Min from his lineage, none perceived the profound sorrow that gripped his heart. Zhao Min was his cherished daughter, and as a token of his affection, he dispatched two of his finest steeds to accompany her and Zhang Wuji on their journey.

From Shaoshi Peak, Chaghan Temur followed the received instructions, heading towards Yangzhou. However, the peculiar nature of the command stirred his suspicion. The order directed him to protect Zhang Shicheng, not attack him. “Could this order originate from Empress Qi?” he pondered. “But if so, she would surely dispatch it through her own trusted courier.”

Without a firm conclusion, Chaghan Temur, in his vexation, led his forces out of Yangzhou, disregarding the command entirely. He journeyed to Suzhou, spending much of his time practicing calligraphy and composing verses, pouring out his longing for his beloved daughter. Had Zhao Min been by his side, she would have deciphered the meaning of the cryptic command.

In the evenings, Chaghan Temur explored the culinary delights of Jiangnan, drawn to its unique eateries. He discovered a stall selling large bakcang (glutinous rice dumplings) filled with pork, duck egg, and almonds. The flavor was singular, the aroma intoxicating. Chaghan found himself enamored.

The stall owner had a daughter, around twenty-five years of age, demure and gentle, though not strikingly beautiful. Yet, when she spoke, her words flowed like a clear stream. She listened attentively as Chaghan discussed political matters, occasionally asking for clarification. Her insights, however, proved remarkably enlightening, reflecting the sentiments of the common folk. The people cared little for who held power, so long as they lived in peace, their daily needs met, and their livelihoods, like that of the food vendors, remained unburdened by oppressive taxes. Such astute observations and genuine concern were absent in Zhao Min’s mother, who held no interest in political affairs.

When Chaghan Temur challenged her to create bakcang with mutton or lamb, she crafted a dish of unparalleled uniqueness, unlike any he had encountered. Her culinary prowess was clearly the family’s mainstay. This likely explained her unmarried status, while her three younger siblings already had children.

As Chaghan Temur frequented the stall, their relationship naturally deepened, and within months, he took her as a concubine. Her family offered no resistance.

Chaghan Temur sent servants, trained by his new wife, to manage the stall, ensuring its continued operation after their departure from Suzhou.

Eventually, Chaghan Temur received word from Ah Da that Toqto'a had been exiled to Yunnan by Hama. Before his departure, Toqto'a instructed his subordinates to obey his successor. Hearing this, Chaghan Temur deliberately made a contrary decision. Instead of protecting Zhang Shicheng, he now sought to attack him.

He was preparing his forces for the assault when he received news that Bolad Temur was marching towards Suzhou with the same intent. Upon hearing this, Chaghan Temur swiftly abandoned his plan, urgently ordering his troops to return to their base in Henan.

Shortly after Chaghan Temur’s departure, Zhang Shicheng seized Suzhou, driving out Bolad Temur. Suzhou was a vital city, a major hub for transportation and trade in Jiangnan. The land he now controlled was not only a primary grain producer but also the source of over half the salt consumed in Zhongyuan.

Zhang Shicheng’s regime mirrored the administrative styles of both the Yuan and Southern Song dynasties. He appointed his brother, Zhang Shixin, as Prime Minister, and Zhang Shide as Grand Commander.

With the establishment of the Zhou Kingdom, many Han Chinese generals from the Yuan Dynasty defected to Zhang Shicheng’s side. Compared to Han Lin’er’s Song territories and Xu Shouhui’s Tianwan Dynasty, Zhang Shicheng’s kingdom was far more prosperous.

**********************

Ma Xiuying dispatched a gift of candied fruits, crafted with her own hands, to Xiangyang. Within the parcel, a brief letter, intended for Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min, was concealed. Upon reading it, they found it contained but a single sentence:

```text
Zhang Shide is under constant surveillance; his capture may be imminent.
Wealth and lands expand, as does collection of women.
```

Ma Xiuying entrusted the delivery of the letter and the delicacies to a young maid, scarcely fourteen years of age, who arrived alongside a courier sent by Zhu Yuanzhang. Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo swiftly discerned that this maiden was Ma Xiuying’s confidante.

When questioned about Ma Xiuying’s well-being, the maid replied, "Ma Furen is in good health, and eagerly anticipates a reunion with Miss Zhou and Miss Zhao."

Zhou Zhiruo, her spirits lifted, responded, "Alas, we are unable to meet her at this juncture. However, you shall sojourn with us for a few days, during which we will impart to you recipes for culinary delights from the northern and western regions. Thus, we need not commit them to parchment."

The courier and the maid remained as guests for several days. From them, they learned that Zhu Yuanzhang, upon seizing Yingtian, governed the territory with exceptional diligence. He diligently patrolled the region with his advisors, ensuring his troops did not inflict misery upon the populace. Any soldier found indulging in free meals and drunken brawls in taverns, or assaulting innocents, faced severe punishment.

On one occasion, Zhu Yuanzhang dined at a tavern and overheard a commotion from the upper floor. It transpired that one of his commanders was entertaining his comrades, refusing to settle the bill. When Zhu Yuanzhang instructed the terrified tavern owner to demand payment, the commander retaliated, striking the owner, who plummeted to his death. Zhu Yuanzhang then brought the deceased’s family to his residence and executed the commander who had led his men in the unpaid feast. Since then, no soldier dared repeat such an offense.

Zhang Wuji was taken aback by this tale. Yet, he conceded that Zhu Yuanzhang’s stern measures were necessary to instill discipline among his troops. He begrudgingly admired Zhu Yuanzhang’s resolve. He inquired, "Does the tavern owner’s surviving family now reside with Zhu Dashuai?"

"Indeed," replied the courier, who was tending to his carriage. "The entire city lauds Dashuai’s decisiveness, though his soldiers are gripped by fear. Consequently, most of them no longer dine at taverns, preferring the meals provided in their encampments."

"They are not forbidden from patronizing taverns," Zhang Wuji clarified. "They are merely prohibited from consuming without payment."

Suddenly, Zhou Zhiruo posed a question, "The tavern owner’s family—how many are they?"

"Not many," the courier replied, hesitating slightly before continuing, "His wife is deceased; there are only a few tavern servants—and two daughters."

"Ah," Zhao Min remarked knowingly, glancing at Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo. "And these daughters are but children, are they not?"

Again, the courier hesitated before responding, "In truth, they are of similar age to Miss Zhao and Miss Zhou."

"Ah," Zhou Zhiruo echoed. "Then they are of marriageable age. Are they wed?"

The courier seemed increasingly reluctant, pausing before answering, "Regarding that, Xiaoren is truly unaware... but aside from them, there appear to be no other family members. Only the tavern servants."

Zhou Zhiruo nodded, ceasing her inquiries.

"It seems the Little Rascal has spawned a Rascal General," Zhao Min quipped as they departed the inn’s courtyard. She smiled broadly. "Miejue Shitai’s assessment of you was not entirely inaccurate."

Zhang Wuji, dismissing her remark as trivial, said, "I am curious about the current situation in Hanyang. Shall we make a detour?"

"Excellent," Zhao Min replied enthusiastically. "Let us race there on horseback!"

They promptly retrieved their steeds and galloped out of Xiangyang’s city gates, heading towards Hanyang. Among the three, Zhao Min was the most skilled rider. Throughout the journey, she playfully challenged Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo to a race, aiming to reach the city before nightfall. Though she could easily outpace them, she maintained a deliberate distance, ensuring they did not fall too far behind. They arrived in Hanyang as the sun began to descend below the western horizon.


## Hanyang, 1356

The city appeared remarkably orderly and clean. The inhabitants, still celebrating Ni Wenjun's and Chen Youliang's grand victory, diligently maintained the city's cleanliness and security. There were no signs of war's devastation, likely repaired and tidied in the preceding days. The air thrummed with the praises of Ni Wenjun's forces, led by Chen Youliang, echoing from pedestrians and tavern keepers alike. Some lauded General Ni Wenjun's leadership, but strangely, none sang praises of Xu Shouhui.

Shortly after their arrival, a torrential downpour descended, adding to their discomfort. Zhang Wuji, feeling hunger's pangs, suggested they seek a tavern for sustenance. Coincidentally, they spotted Wu Zhanglao and three Six-Pouch Beggars conversing at a street corner. Upon seeing them, Wu Zhanglao greeted them warmly, "Zhang Jiaozhu! We were about to depart for Xiangyang with a message from Peng Dashi, never expecting to encounter you here."

Wu Zhanglao led them to a secluded spot for conversation. Peng Yingyu had found no means to dissuade Ni Wenjun from relocating the capital to Hanyang, as Xu Shouhui, elated by their victory, readily acquiesced to Ni Wenjun's intent. Currently, both Peng Yingyu and Xu Shouhui were en route to Hanyang to meet with Ni Wenjun and Chen Youliang.

"Where does Chen Youliang reside in this city?" Zhang Wuji inquired.

"To the west of here," Wu Zhanglao replied. "If Zhang Jiaozhu wishes to meet him, we can guide you."

However, Zhao Min interjected, "Wuji Gege, I suggest we delay our meeting. Let us first gather more information about his recent activities." She turned to Wu Zhanglao. "Perhaps Wu Zhanglao is more knowledgeable in this regard."

Wu Zhanglao appeared vexed. He said, "That... man surnamed Chen has at least four wives and two grown sons. We only recently learned of this. We should have known earlier, during his time with the Beggars' Sect. His residence in Hanyang rivals Han Lin'er's palace in Bozhou. Ni Wenjun and Xu Shouhui indulge him greatly."

Zhang Wuji was astounded. He asked, "Does Peng Dashi know of this?"

"Of course," Wu Zhanglao replied. "But what can he do? Xu Shouhui trusts Chen Youliang implicitly."

Zhang Wuji understood that for someone like Xu Shouhui, victory over the Yuan Dynasty overshadowed Chen Youliang's lifestyle. He was unsurprised by Xu Shouhui's indifference. However, this signaled that Chen Youliang no longer regarded Xu Shouhui and Peng Yingyu as his superiors.

After a moment's contemplation, Zhang Wuji concluded that attempting to reason with these victory-intoxicated leaders was futile. He penned a brief message for Peng Yingyu and entrusted it to Wu Zhanglao. Following dinner, they promptly returned to Xiangyang.

During their journey back, Zhou Zhiruo remarked, "Wuji Gege, I feel Liu Bowen's prophecy is nearing its fulfillment."

"Indeed," Zhang Wuji concurred. "But we cannot allow these men to oppress the populace or engage in internecine warfare."

"Then what will you do?"

"I know not," Zhang Wuji replied, lost in thought. "But I must attempt something."

Zhao Min said, "I merely wish to spare you disappointment."

Zhang Wuji halted his steed, gazing at her intently before saying, "Why should I be disappointed? Today, I witnessed the city's residents in joyous celebration. Even if there are disappointments, this sight suffices."

"You deceive yourself," Zhou Zhiruo stated.

Zhang Wuji countered, "And do you feel disappointment at the thought of this war's conclusion?"

Zhou Zhiruo shook her head. "I know not. At times, I yearn for time to halt when my father was alive, and we were children, residing on a boat on the Han River. But then, you were grievously wounded..." She paused, then continued coldly, "I care little for this war's outcome."

Zhao Min chuckled, "I must admit, you two are a fitting pair. I have no such memories. I was never close to my mother. And now, my father disowns me. I do not regret my decision to..." Her cheeks flushed, and she changed the subject, "In any case, I have no regrets."

Zhou Zhiruo understood her meaning. She also chuckled and asked, "Meizi, what kind of life do you desire?"

"I have always wished to experience life in my ancestors' homeland," Zhao Min replied. "They dwelled far to the north, northwest of here. Perhaps I would herd horses, sheep, goats, and cattle. Each day, I would lead them to graze in the open plains, occasionally facing the challenge of wolves. Since Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty, the Naiman people have lived in Zhongyuan's great cities. They have assimilated with the Han and Mongol tribes, so even my mother never experienced such a life. My father was born in Zhongyuan, and my mother in Xinjiang, but not in such untamed lands."

Their conversation continued until they returned to their inn in Xiangyang. By then, the sun had risen, and the streets were bustling with merchants setting up their wares. They purchased a few steamed buns for a quick breakfast. Exhausted, they fell into a deep slumber, not waking until well past midday.

For the next two days, Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo dedicated their time to teaching Ah Fong, Ma Xiuying's maid, the promised culinary skills, while contemplating the message they wished to convey to their patron. In the evenings, they resumed their martial arts practice in the inn's courtyard, under Zhang Wuji's guidance.

During their months in Xiangyang, Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo's martial prowess had improved significantly. Zhou Zhiruo rectified the fatal errors she had made while learning the Jiu Yin Baigu Zhua without guidance, driven by haste and vengeance. She now diligently meditated, striving to erase her previous training and begin the Jiu Yin Shen Gong anew. In the evenings, she and Zhao Min practiced Taiji techniques, as recommended by Zhang Sanfeng.

Zhao Min, starting the Jiu Yang Shen Gong from scratch, faced no such difficulties. Unlike Zhou Zhiruo, she had received no prior internal cultivation instruction from Fan Yao. She was like a blank canvas of exceptional quality. With her innate intelligence and talent, she absorbed Zhang Wuji's teachings effortlessly. However, her internal energy was still far from perfect. She practiced without burden, having long resigned herself to a perceived lack of talent.

Each evening, as Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min practiced Taiji forms, the inn's patrons gathered, watching in awe. Their movements were graceful and fluid, devoid of any harshness. At first glance, Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min appeared to be engaged in a partnered dance. But when Zhou Zhiruo wielded her long whip and Zhao Min drew her sword, the crowd retreated, sensing the chilling aura that accompanied Zhou Zhiruo's whip. The whip snaked and coiled with an uncanny slowness, then suddenly lashed out with unpredictable speed. Zhao Min's sword, seemingly moving without force, magically spiraled and pulsed with a warm yet gentle energy upon contact with the whip. The combined display of their weapons was breathtaking. The audience repeatedly erupted in applause, especially during their coordinated sword and whip sequences.

Through their shared practice, the two women discovered a unique way to harmonize their seemingly opposing forces. Zhao Min cultivated Zhang Wuji's "Yang" or "hot" energy, while Zhou Zhiruo utilized the "Yin" or "cold" energy of the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing, which, to the audience, exuded a feminine grace befitting her appearance. Zhang Wuji himself had never dared to combine these two energies, having never practiced the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing. Yet, these contrasting forces were now wielded by two distinct individuals.

After a while, Zhou Zhiruo coiled her whip around her waist and drew a slender sword from her back. She cried out, "Meizi, our Yin Yang Sword Formation!"

As Zhou Zhiruo finished her call, their swords flashed in tandem, aiming at Zhang Wuji, who was observing their practice from the courtyard's edge. The audience's applause swelled, drawing more spectators.

This new sword technique was based on the Emei Sword Style and a fusion of the Kunlun and Huashan sword techniques Zhao Min had learned while holding the six great sects captive at Wan An Temple. They had devised this combined technique, inspired by Zhou Zhiruo's observation of He Taichong and his wife's coordinated assault, as well as the tall and short Huashan swordsmen's teamwork against Zhang Wuji at Guangming Peak. Now, they integrated these techniques with Zhou Zhiruo's Emei sword skills.

Zhang Wuji was startled by this formidable attack. He leaped high and somersaulted away, exclaiming, "Impressive!" He clasped his hands together, grinning. "Frankly, I have yet to find a way to break this formation," he said, laughing. "At Guangming Peak, I won by sheer luck, thanks to your guidance. Now, with you combining the skills of those four with Emei swordplay, Zhang Wuji must concede defeat."

Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min sheathed their swords, laughing. "You concede without a fight?" Zhao Min said. "Zhang Jiaozhu underestimates us."

Zhang Wuji's admission was sincere. He had never excelled in weapon mastery. While Zhang Sanfeng had taught him Taiji Sword, it was essentially Taiji fist techniques adapted for a sword. He had used the Tulong Saber against the three Persian envoys, but only to counter their weapons. His father had instilled in him the fundamentals of unarmed combat. He later learned the Shen Huo Ling techniques, which utilized strange weapons, but their principles resembled Taiji Sword, unlike the Kunlun, Huashan, or Emei sword styles, designed specifically for swordsmanship.

When facing the combined assault of He Taichong and the others at Guangming Peak, he had struggled, ultimately winning by tricking He Taichong and his wife, feigning poisoning. Thus, against Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min's sword formation, he could only rely on his superior internal energy, which they currently lacked. But he had no desire to engage in an internal energy contest with them.

Their combined sword technique was truly ingenious. Zhang Wuji knew it could only be countered by the Seven Wudang Swords Formation. But with his father and Mo Shenggu deceased, and Yu Daiyan still incapacitated, the formation was incomplete. Moreover, their Yin Yang sword movements directly countered the Seven Wudang Swords Formation's weaknesses. Both formations shared the Bagua principles but had diverged in their development.

When Zhao Min witnessed He Taichong's swordplay, she was unsure how to apply it in combat. After seeing Fan Yao's modified demonstration, she still lacked the necessary internal energy, and Fan Yao refused to teach her. Now, with the pure internal energy from Zhang Wuji's Jiu Yang Shen Gong, she easily grasped the essence of He Taichong and Ban Shuxian's sword techniques, and with Zhou Zhiruo's guidance, integrated them with the Huashan sword techniques she had stolen from the captured tall and short swordsmen.

Zhang Wuji had heard tales of Yang Guo and Xiao Longnu's combined swordplay from his grandmaster. He saw a resemblance between their technique and Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min's, perhaps even surpassing it, given their combined, albeit still developing, internal energies from the Jiu Yin and Jiu Yang Zhen Jing.

Days drifted into weeks, and before they knew it, a year had passed since their last sojourn to Wudang, to stand before the venerable Zhang Sanfeng. A deep yearning for the aged sage stirred within them, and they purposed to visit him after the twin celebrations of Zhao Min's and Zhou Zhiruo's birthdays, and the marking of the New Year.

Yet, fate intervened, bringing them face to face with Yu Lianzhou, who had descended the mountain with deliberate intent, seeking them in Xiangyang.

"Second Martial Uncle!" Zhang Wuji exclaimed, his voice laced with joyous surprise. "Rarely do you leave the mountain's embrace. What tidings do you bear?"

"Our Master is in robust health," Yu Lianzhou replied, his countenance serene. "He yearns for your presence, all three of you, and thus dispatched third-generation disciples to seek you in Hanyang. They, in their haste, sent word by swift-winged pigeon, prompting my immediate journey to meet you here. Upon your last visit, your sixth uncle had just welcomed a son, named Yin Zhong Han, after the ancient sage, Yin Zhong Kan, and the Han Dynasty. We extend to you an invitation to attend the ceremony our Master will hold to bless the child upon his first year, a mere two months hence."

A warmth, like the gentle caress of spring, spread through the hearts of Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo, as they heard of Zhang Sanfeng's abiding care. Zhang Wuji felt a surge of joy at the news of Yang Buhui's childbirth, yet a shadow of melancholy soon darkened his features. He recalled that they had yet to deliver any truly heartening news to their grandmaster, save for Zhu Yuanzhang's burgeoning influence. On Xu Shouhui's side, they remained bereft of a means to forestall Chen Youliang's predicted treachery, a prediction that drew ever closer to reality.

As he recounted their tribulations, Yu Lianzhou sighed, a sound heavy with the weight of experience. "Wuji, we are not always granted the power to avert the coming storm, even when its approach is plain to see. Our Master has made known to me the nature of your endeavors. From what I perceive, his foremost concern lies in your alliance with Zhu Yuanzhang and Ma Xiuying, and from your words, you have executed his wishes with commendable diligence."

A measure of relief washed over the three youths, as Yu Lianzhou's words eased their troubled minds.

Zhang Wuji declared, "Then, I believe we shall accompany Second Martial Uncle to Wudang. We have long yearned for the presence of our Grand Master."

After entrusting a letter for Peng Yingyu to the care of Wu Zhanglao, they promptly set forth, their steeds carrying them swiftly towards the hallowed peaks of Wudang Mountain, with Yu Lianzhou as their guide.
