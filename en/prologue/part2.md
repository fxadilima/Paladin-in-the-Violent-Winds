# Prologue

## *Journey to Wudang: The Unveiling Truth*

The distance from Chuzhou to Wudang Shan in Hubei wasn't too far, but it wasn't particularly close either. Along the road leaving the area, they often heard people on the streets muttering curses full of hatred towards the Yuan Dynasty and the Mongols. They also heard rows of small children singing verses about the Yellow River, exalting the rebels.

"What are they singing?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

"Songs like that are common in this region," Zhang Wuji said. "Disturb the Yellow River, the people rebel!"

"All of this started with the government's project to dredge and reorganize the Yellow River," Zhao Min said. "Of course, the government had reasons for doing so, as there had been a major flood previously due to the Yellow River overflowing. Do you have another idea on how to deal with it?"

Zhang Wuji had heard Yang Xiao's explanation of this event, and after pondering it, he still couldn't answer Zhao Min's question. All he knew was that after the project was implemented, the people suffered greatly; poverty was everywhere. Additionally, the people mobilized by Toqto'a for the work were also dissatisfied with the wages they received. Still pondering what exactly happened due to that massive project, he didn't answer Zhao Min's question.

They were riding leisurely at that time, and looking into the distance, Zhao Min asked, "Do you know who actually rebelled first? Even before that project?"

Zhang Wuji was born on Ice and Fire Island, very far from there. Since childhood, he only knew his parents and Xie Xun. They taught him how to read and write, told him many fascinating stories, and also taught him martial arts. But of course, no one taught him about politics in Zhongyuan until he met Yang Xiao, Shuobude, Peng Yingyu, and the others. As for Zhou Zhiruo, she had no mother since childhood, and eventually, her father died when she was ten years old. Zhang Wuji witnessed that incident. Miejue Shitai often talked about politics and referred to the Mongols as 'barbarians' with deep hatred. As a result, she and all Emei disciples were influenced. But when she heard Zhao Min's question, she had to admit that she didn't know.

"As far as I know, Grandmaster Peng was the first to teach the people in the north about the 'Bright King'," Zhang Wuji answered. "That's why Han Shantong was later dubbed the Mingwang, and even 'Maitreya Buddha' by the people. After that, Guo Zixing and the others followed in their footsteps."

"That only happened later," Zhao Min said. "That is, after we were born. What about before that?"

Zhou Zhiruo laughed. "I'm already lost here; I don't understand what you two are talking about," she said. "Frankly, I've never been interested in political matters like this."

Suddenly, Zhang Wuji said casually, "If you want to know, maybe you could chat with Han Lin'er. I'm sure he'd be happy to answer all your questions." In his heart, Zhang Wuji hoped that by joking slightly about Han Lin'er's status, he could gauge Zhou Zhiruo's reaction and perhaps dampen the subtle hidden ambition he sensed in her.

Zhou Zhiruo seemed a bit annoyed. She asked, "What do your words mean? Why should I ask Han Lin'er?" She felt offended by Zhang Wuji's comment. Why should she deal with an inexperienced boy who had just been appointed emperor? Didn't Zhang Wuji know who had truly been in her heart all this time? Or had the memory of her now been completely overshadowed by the presence of this little girl? She couldn't believe it!

Zhao Min burst into laughter. "Zhou Jiejie, you still don't understand our Wuji Gege," she said. "Han Lin'er greatly admires you, and he's now an emperor." Zhao Min caught Zhang Wuji's joking tone, although she also sensed the tension between the two.

"What kind of person do you think I am?" Zhou Zhiruo said angrily. "Han Lin'er is just a young boy." She then smiled and said to Zhao Min, "Meizi, I think you're a better match for Han Lin'er." Zhou Zhiruo, feeling cornered, changed the subject and taunted Zhao Min, considering their relatively close ages. Zhao Min was only about two or three years younger than Han Lin'er.

Zhao Min shook her head, smiling. She said, "You Han people are too busy opposing the government, that's why you don't know what's happening in the palace."

Something in her tone piqued Zhou Zhiruo's curiosity. "What does that have to do with the palace?"

"You just said Han Lin'er was just a young boy. Do you think the Emperor was an adult when he married Empress Qi?" Zhao Min continued. "The Emperor was only thirteen years old then!"

"Who is this Empress Qi?" Zhou Zhiruo asked, surprised.

Again, Zhao Min laughed. "Of course, the empress of the Yuan Dynasty Emperor, Toghon Temur."

This time Zhang Wuji was astonished. He asked, "Was she a Han woman?"

"No," Zhao Min replied. "She was from Goryeo. She was five years older than the Emperor. So when they married, the Emperor was only thirteen, even younger than Han Lin'er is now. Empress Qi was eighteen. Yet they married."

"So you're not too late to become Empress Han Lin'er," Zhang Wuji said with a light laugh.

Zhou Zhiruo was deeply offended and didn't respond.

Zhang Wuji realized his remark had been a bit out of line, so he quickly said, "Alright, I went a bit too far just now. I apologize."

"Your apology doesn't sound sincere," Zhou Zhiruo said. She averted her gaze. This Zhang Wuji... does he truly not understand my feelings? Or is he deliberately pretending not to know?

Zhao Min moved her horse closer to Zhou Zhiruo and said softly, "Zhou Jiejie, come on, don't mind him. I think he's just jealous."

"If he could actually be jealous, then you wouldn't have been able to cancel our wedding in Haozhou," Zhou Zhiruo said. She turned to Zhang Wuji and said curtly, "Even if you don't like me, you don't need to throw me to someone else. I don't need your pity."

Zhang Wuji didn't respond to her comment. At that moment, they were passing a tavern and caught the fragrant scent of roast duck from inside. He said, "I'm very hungry, how about we stop there?"

"I'm hungry too," Zhao Min said happily. She immediately dismounted, inviting Zhou Zhiruo to do the same, and they entered the tavern hand in hand. Zhang Wuji thought, "Women are truly hard to understand. Now I've turned into the villain, and the two of them are like sisters. All because of a joke about Han Lin'er."

They ate in relative silence, only Zhao Min hungrily finished two bowls of rice and tasted two types of vegetable dishes. Lately, she had diligently practiced all the moves she learned from Fan Yao and all the skills she 'stole' from the six major sects. Fan Yao didn't teach her anything about internal energy or qinggong. All her training utilized her arm and leg muscles, and being still young, all that food made her grow taller and stronger. She now looked more athletic and needed more food.

Suddenly, Zhang Wuji remembered something and asked, "Did you mean Empress Qi rebelled?"

"No," Zhao Min said. "This is related to Kusala, Emperor Toghon Temur's father. But it wasn't him who rebelled either. More precisely, there was a series of rebellions in the palace, until El Temur came to power as Prime Minister and simultaneously Regent for the emperor."

Zhang Wuji had never heard this story. "How could something like that happen?" he asked.

"At that time, the Grand Council of the Yuan Dynasty was divided into two factions," Zhao Min said as she filled her empty bowl with boiled peanuts, sliced onions, and chilies. "The first supported orthodox Mongolian ways, and the second preferred Kongzi's teachings and wanted to implement governance methods like the Han Dynasty, which is why they learned a lot from the Han people. They were also willing to pay handsomely for Han teachers. Kusala, the current Emperor's father, belonged to this second group. Or he pioneered this movement. At that time, he had many supporters in the palace, and El Temur greatly disliked him." She ate a few peanuts with chili and onion slices, then took a wineskin from her bundle. But when poured into a small bowl, the contents looked like milk, seemingly with an alcoholic aroma. She quickly finished the drink, then refilled her empty bowl. Zhou Zhiruo watched her curiously.

Zhou Zhiruo asked, "Meizi, what was that you just drank?"

"Do you want to try it?" Zhao Min asked, then took the empty bowl in front of Zhou Zhiruo and poured a little drink from her wineskin.

Zhou Zhiruo tasted it somewhat hesitantly. A moment later, her beautiful eyes widened, and she finished the drink in one gulp. "This is delicious," she said sincerely. "Next time you must teach me how to make it."

Happily, Zhao Min filled Zhou Zhiruo's bowl with the drink. "This is called airag. It's made from mare's milk, tastes a bit sour, and also like wine, but it's not strong. If you like it, I'll tell you how to make it later." She picked up some peanuts with onion slices with her chopsticks, smiling broadly.

Zhou Zhiruo was actually hungry, but being annoyed after hearing Zhang Wuji's comment about Han Lin'er, she had lost her appetite. Now, seeing how Zhao Min ate, she suddenly realized her hunger, and unconsciously, she began to take the food she hadn't touched since earlier.

Zhang Wuji was happy to see Zhou Zhiruo begin to eat. He then took his own bowl and quickly finished a bowl of rice. "I see, so El Temur chose Tugh Temur, Kusala's younger brother, at that time. Then what happened to Kusala?"

"He was exiled to Yunnan," Zhao Min replied. "But then he fled to the territory of the Chagatai family, in Central Asia. Previously, he tried to stage a rebellion in Shaanxi, but failed. After that, he was supported by the Chagatai circles and married a woman from the Karluks tribe there, named Mailaiti."

"If that rebellion failed, then how did Emperor Toghon Temur ascend the throne?" Zhang Wuji asked in surprise.

---

Suddenly, Zhao Min burst out laughing. "You think becoming emperor is that easy?" she said, calling a servant to order two more roast ducks and many steamed buns to take along for their journey. "First, you need to know that Tugh Temur didn't just ascend to the throne effortlessly," she continued after the servant left. "Their father, Emperor Khayishan, or Kulug Khan, feuded with his mother, who was from the Khonggirad tribe, like Chabi, Kublai Khan's wife. The Khonggirad tribe was considered the primary choice for an empress. But Khayishan married a woman from the Ikhires tribe. This caused tension with his mother and younger brother, Ayurbarwada. Eventually, Khayishan was forced to appoint Ayurbarwada as crown prince, with the agreement that after Ayurbarwada ascended the throne, he would appoint Kusala as crown prince." Then she cleared her throat, glanced at Zhou Zhiruo, and added with a slightly different tone, "It would be quite interesting, wouldn't it, if there were a 'Han empress' and a Naiman empress for an 'emperor' later on."

"Wow, I didn't realize the story was so complicated," Zhang Wuji said, pretending not to understand the implication of that last sentence.

It was then that Zhou Zhiruo finally became interested in Zhao Min's political narrative. "That sounds very interesting," she said, her eyes starting to sparkle. "Khayishan dared to defy his mother and marry a woman from another tribe? I guess what happens next is predictable: Ayurbarwada broke his promise!"

Zhao Min nodded. "That's right, but it wasn't Ayurbarwada who broke his promise. After Ayurbarwada died, almost all members of the Khonggirad family agreed to enthrone Ayurbarwada's son, Shidibala, as Khan, and also Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. Their reason, of course, was that Kusala was the son of an Ikhires woman. To ensure the plan went smoothly, Kusala was exiled to Yunnan but granted the title of King of Chou."

"That's terrible, again, just because he's the son of a woman from another tribe!" Zhou Zhiruo exclaimed. It wasn't clear to Zhang Wuji what was on Zhou Zhiruo's mind when she said this. Within a Mongolian family context, "another tribe" could indeed refer to Zhou Zhiruo herself, but from another perspective, it seemed like she was defending Zhao Min. Zhou Zhiruo had grown up hating the Mongols, but here she was, perhaps unknowingly, empathizing with their internal struggles, or was she simply defending Zhao Min, a "woman from another tribe" herself? Zhang Wuji felt a mix of surprise and a strange sense of hope that her deep-seated prejudices might be softening.

He asked, "Why was only Kusala exiled? Wasn't Tugh Temur also Khayishan's son?"

Zhao Min secretly felt pleased to hear Zhou Zhiruo's remark about 'women from other tribes,' but she answered in a normal tone, "Of course, because Tugh Temur wasn't the crown prince. Therefore, he was considered not dangerous. But don't think Shidibala ended up living safely on the throne. He was later assassinated by Yesun Temur in a coup. This Yesun Temur then became Khan. Now, after he died, a war broke out between the two capitals, Shangdu and Dadu. Ragibagh, Yesun Temur's son, ascended the throne, but then Tugh Temur, who resided in Dadu, rebelled against him, with El Temur's support. General Bayan, who was then the governor of Henan, also supported him."

"This is an extraordinary story, why have I never heard it?" Zhang Wuji asked. He often heard Fan Yao and Yang Xiao tell stories about the war between the two capitals. They seemed rather proud of their experiences looting rich people's homes during this period, but he had never heard about the political reasons behind it.

"Because after that series of rebellions ended with Tugh Temur's faction winning, that's when the Han rebellions began, starting with Zhou Ziwang!" Zhao Min replied.

"Ah, Chang Yuchun mentioned that name when my father died by the Han River," Zhou Zhiruo said. "Zhou Ziwang's son also died then."

"You know, Han Shantong was arguably very influenced by Grandmaster Peng's teachings about the coming of Maitreya Buddha, and then people believed he was the coming Maitreya Buddha. That's why you never heard about what happened in the palace; people were just busy talking about this."

Zhang Wuji was just beginning to understand what was really happening behind all these rebellions. He knew that before starting his rebellion, Liu Futong was a Yuan Dynasty official. And later, he became Han Shantong's advisor. Now he was Han Lin'er's advisor, also the Grand Advisor of the new Song Dynasty, and simultaneously held the post of Prime Minister. He felt his decision to keep a close eye on Liu Futong was correct, and he felt relieved. "Min Mei, you still haven't told us how Emperor Toghon Temur finally ascended the throne," he said.

"Well, after Tugh Temur ascended the throne, he eventually invited Kusala back to Dadu," Zhao Min replied. "At that time, Kusala brought a large amount of military support from the Chagatai circles to Mongolia, to Karakorum. Seeing this, the princes in Karakorum immediately supported him. Tugh Temur was then terrified by that military might; he was under immense pressure. Kusala declared himself the Great Khan in Mongolia, and two months later El Temur arrived, bringing the official imperial seal to Mongolia. He announced that Dadu intended to support him. A month later, Kusala reciprocated by appointing his younger brother, Tugh Temur, as Crown Prince."

"Kusala seems like a good emperor," Zhang Wuji said.

Zhao Min smiled. "He was indeed good, but unfortunately, he didn't get to become a true Emperor or Khan," she said. "Do you think others will reciprocate chivalry with the same?"

"What happened next?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

"Kusala departed from Karakorum with only eighteen hundred men for Dadu. Two months later, he met Tugh Temur in Ongguchatu. There, Tugh Temur had already built the city of Zhongdu. Suddenly, Kusala died four days after a banquet with Tugh Temur. A month later, Tugh Temur ascended the throne for the second time, as Great Khan of Mongolia and simultaneously Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty."

"Crazy!" Zhang Wuji exclaimed in shock. Unconsciously, he slammed the edge of the table. "Absolutely ruthless! Killing his own older brother."

Zhang Wuji had heard stories from Xie Xun and Zhang Sanfeng about Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, who pretended to abdicate and hand the throne to his son, Qinzong, for fear of an invasion by the Jin people. Qinzong was initially afraid to accept the throne, also fearing the invading Jin, until Huizong ordered a eunuch to force Qinzong onto the throne. Ironically, both emperors were eventually captured by the invading Jin, who established the Jin Dynasty in the northern regions. This humiliating incident for the Song Dynasty caused their territory to be halved, and as a result, it was called the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Zhao Gou, who fled south, managed to preserve the Song, though only half of it. But then, when the Jin intended to release Qinzong due to pressure from General Yue Fei, he feared that Qinzong would reclaim the throne, which was formerly his right, so he halted General Yue Fei's struggle against the Jin, even though Yue Fei was on the verge of victory. At this moment, Zhang Wuji felt a similarity between Zhao Gou's actions, who eventually became Emperor Gaozong, and Tugh Temur's actions.

"For the sake of the throne, people will do anything," Zhou Zhiruo said. She had also heard the same story from Miejue Shitai. She felt it was truly insane that she had once been joyful upon hearing Peng Yingyu say that she would become Zhang Wuji's empress once their struggle against the Yuan Dynasty succeeded. As Zhao Min recounted Khayishan being opposed by his own mother, she shivered, imagining a mother causing her own two sons to fight over the throne.

"Now to answer your question," Zhao Min said to Zhang Wuji. "Before Tugh Temur died, he regretted his actions and instructed his empress, Budashiri, to pass the throne to Kusala's son. At that time, El Temur was already in power, but Budashiri was ultimately deemed more worthy of making decisions by the Grand Council."

Zhang Wuji nodded. "So, that's how Toghon Temur finally became emperor."

But Zhao Min shook her head. "It's still not that simple," she said. "Kusala had another wife named Babusha, besides Meilaiti. Meilaiti was Toghon Temur's mother, while Babusha was the mother of Rinchinbal, who was only six years old at the time, while Toghon was thirteen. So El Temur felt Toghon was too old to be fully controlled. He preferred Rinchinbal. Toghon was exiled to Goryeo."

"But didn't you say Budashiri was more respected by the Council?" Zhang Wuji asked. "Did she also agree?"

"Budashiri had no military power," Zhao Min said. "So she then thought, after all, both were Kusala's sons, meaning whoever ascended the throne, she would still have carried out Tugh Temur's last wish."

"And Rinchinbal eventually ascended the throne?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

"That's right," Zhao Min replied. "But he then died, two months before being crowned emperor. After that, El Temur wanted to enthrone Tugh Temur's son, El Tegus, as emperor."

"That sounds like El Temur's doing," Zhou Zhiruo interjected. "He deliberately killed Rinchinbal, one way or another."

"I don't know about that," Zhao Min said, a faint, almost imperceptible smirk playing on her lips. "What's clear is that his plan didn't go smoothly either."

"Was Toghon still in Goryeo at that time?" Zhang Wuji asked.

Zhao Min shook her head again. "He had been moved to Guangxi," she said.

"Ah, I know!" Zhou Zhiruo interjected again. "It was when he was exiled to Goryeo that he met Empress Qi!"

Zhao Min smiled widely. "It seems Zhou Jiejie is very interested in the story of Empress Qi," she said. Her smile widened even more when she saw Zhou Zhiruo blush. "You are correct, but everyone assumes they met in Dadu. In the Yuan Dynasty Palace. Because Qi Shengniang, Empress Qi's nickname, was indeed sent to the Yuan Dynasty by the King of Goryeo. They were obliged to send women as tribute to the Yuan Dynasty every three years."

"To be concubines?" Zhou Zhiruo asked again.

"Hmph," Zhao Min snorted. "You think it's that easy? Usually, they became servants, or entertainers for generals. Even if they became concubines, they'd be of the lowest rank."

Zhang Wuji, still curious, brought the conversation back to the main topic, "You said Toghon was still in Guangxi, then he was summoned back to the palace?"

"Yes, but initially he didn't want to, because El Temur was very wicked," Zhao Min replied. She looked outside and saw the sun beginning to dip towards the western horizon, then quickly finished the remaining airag in her bowl. "This is a very long story. Right now, we need to hurry to the nearest town before dark. We still have plenty of time for stories anyway."


---

They continued their journey and found an inn in the nearest town. Zhou Zhiruo was eager to hear the story of Empress Qi, but Zhang Wuji was curious about El Temur's actions. Since they were racing on horseback, that curiosity had to be postponed until they arrived at a rather simple inn in a small town. The inn didn't provide food, but luckily Zhao Min had bought plenty earlier, so they could have dinner on the inn's porch while continuing the story, after refreshing themselves and ordering two rooms. Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min stayed in one room, and Zhang Wuji booked a smaller room for himself.

He then pressed Zhao Min to tell him more. "It's fortunate for Toghon that Empress Budashiri existed; at least he was allowed to live. I suspect Rinchinbal's death is also mysterious; perhaps El Temur ordered someone to poison his food."

"That matter is indeed mysterious," Zhao Min said. "To this day, there's no definitive answer. But you should know, while Toghon was still in Guangxi, Budashiri ordered that Babusha, Rinchinbal's mother — who was also Toghon's stepmother — *be executed*. At that time, Tugh Temur appointed his son, Aratnadara, as crown prince. But a month later, Aratnadara died, and Tugh Temur finally put forward El Tegus as crown prince."

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo were very surprised. "Wouldn't that make him an enemy of Toghon himself? How could he still insist on appointing Toghon as emperor, and not his own son?"

"Just as Khayishan forced Ayurbarwada to appoint Kusala as crown prince, Budashiri also eventually forced Toghon to appoint El Tegus as crown prince," Zhao Min replied.

"That's truly cunning," Zhou Zhiruo interjected. "So her actions of appointing Toghon and Rinchinbal as emperors were not sincere! In that case, it would have been better if they hadn't become emperors — but remained alive."

Zhang Wuji sighed sadly, then said, "Those poor children. It seems they were elevated to the highest positions, but in reality, their lives were always on the brink."

"The 'children' you speak of, one is already dead, and the other is now in his thirties," Zhao Min said with a wide smile. "All these stories happened when you were very young; I wasn't even born yet."

"And I was still on *Binghuo Dao*[^binghuo-dao] with Yifu and my parents," Zhang Wuji added, echoing Zhao Min's comment. "Sometimes I feel, it would have been better if my parents hadn't left the island then. Wouldn't we have still lived happily there, and they wouldn't have had to commit suicide?"

[^binguo-dao]: Binghuo Dao (冰火島), "Ice and Fire Island".

At that, Zhou Zhiruo's annoyance vanished instantly, her heart softening. She said with deep concern, "Don't think that way. We can't turn back time, and they left the island for your sake. They wanted you to enjoy a decent life in Zhongyuan. If you had stayed on the island, how would you have spent your time alone after the three of them eventually passed away? Wouldn't everyone eventually die anyway? That's unavoidable. And if you had stayed there, wouldn't you have died without leaving descendants?"

After she spoke that last sentence, the atmosphere suddenly fell silent. Zhou Zhiruo's words made all three of them realize their current situation. They understood that both Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo still held a request for Zhang Wuji. If Zhao Min had previously asked Zhang Wuji not to marry Zhou Zhiruo in Haozhou, then now Zhou Zhiruo would certainly forbid him from marrying Zhao Min. And then Zhao Min would surely make a similar request. After a moment, without realizing it, all three laughed together, each laughing at themselves.

Zhao Min looked at the crescent moon in the sky, then began to recite a poem with an elegant grace. Her voice was clear and melodious. "*Swift to love, swift to hate, who truly shares my joy and sorrow? Human life, a fleeting breeze, soon to dust, vanishing with time...*"

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo clapped after she finished the song. Although both of them were Han, when it came to literature and art, they had to admit that Zhao Min, who had been surrounded by talented tutors since childhood, was far superior to them. Zhang Wuji recalled the poem Zhao Min had written as an expression of her admiration when looking at Yitian Jian in *Bianliang*[^bianliang]. He would never be able to write such a poem. It seemed it wasn't due to Zhao Min's literary tutors, but her own innate talent in art. Zhou Zhiruo began to feel that what Miejue Shitai had said about 'wild tribes' seemed somewhat excessive. It wasn't a conscious rejection of her Shifu's teachings, but a subtle unease was stirring within her, a quiet acknowledgment that the world was far more complex than the stark divisions she had always been taught.

[^bianliang]: Bianliang (汴梁) is the old name for Kaifeng, which is still often used today. Literaly, it means 'Opening the border'.

"I can't sing," Zhou Zhiruo said. "And my handwriting is terrible too. It's fortunate that Shifu taught me to read and write, so I'm not illiterate. You understand Han traditions and culture much better than us."

"Do you still remember the beginning of my story? My father's family belonged to the Naiman tribe—like Babusha—who were eventually conquered by Genghis Khan. Originally, my father's ancestors lived in Xinjiang, but after Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty, their family moved to Shengqiu. They eventually followed Kublai Khan and embraced Tibetan Buddhism. My father's family was among those who supported the implementation of Kongzi's teachings and Han culture within the Yuan Dynasty," Zhao Min said. She smiled. "But I suppose you also know, because both Wang Baobao and my father speak Han well."

"I heard Wang Baobao isn't your biological elder brother," Zhang Wuji said.

"That's right, I should call him Biaoge[^biaoge]. This is somewhat similar to you and Yin Li," Zhao Min said. "But my father adopted him after his own father died."

[^biaoge]: Biaoge (表哥) is an older male cousin on the mother's side.

"No wonder you truly resemble Wang Baobao," Zhou Zhiruo said.

Zhao Min giggled, then said, "He resembles his mother, and I resemble my father. Neither of us resembles the Naiman tribe. For several generations, most of my father's ancestors indeed married women from the Han tribe. Unlike El Temur or General Bayan."

"Those two generals sound very cruel," Zhang Wuji said.

"They were somewhat different," Zhao Min said. "El Temur clearly didn't support Han traditions. I don't fully understand this myself. But what's clear is that the schools teaching Han language and all of Kongzi's teachings, complete with Han traditions and culture, all originated from Kusala's idea. General Bayan was a bit strange. He disliked people mixing Mongolian culture with Han culture, and opposed policies with a Han flavor in the government. He even abolished the Imperial Examinations that my father once took. That action was truly foolish and antiquated. But it turns out he deeply hated officials who acted arbitrarily against the poor during his time as Darughachi in Henan. He wouldn't hesitate to eliminate officials who did so."

"Oh, so you were imitating him then," Zhang Wuji said. He remembered the first time he saw Zhao Min, she and the Eight Divine Arrows eliminating a gang of Yuan soldiers who were oppressing the people.

"At that time, I hadn't heard my father's stories about General Bayan," Zhao Min said. "Frankly, I did it because such actions would make you, the Han people, hate us Mongols even more. And I really didn't like how they wantonly robbed the common folk, even though my father paid them quite high salaries."

Zhang Wuji said with a serious face, "I have to admit, your father's way of carrying out his duties in Henan is commendable. Your father was a loyal and honest official. I can see that this made the people love him very much, which is why the provocations from Han Lin'er and the Ming Cult would not be heeded by most of the people in your father's domain." He sighed deeply, then continued, gazing into the distance with a distant look, "Unfortunately, we and your father represent opposing sides."

Meanwhile, Zhao Min couldn't guess what the other two were thinking, but she felt that at least she had tried to convey how unimportant these factions, which to her were all the same, truly were. In her heart, she was quite satisfied.

---

Throughout their journey to Wudang, Zhang Wuji pondered all this repeatedly without finding a definitive answer. They arrived at the foot of Wudang Mountain in a few days, and there he was reminded of his father and mother. He said to the two girls riding beside him, "Let's speed up; I want to visit my parents' graves."

Upon arriving at the Wudang burial site, they were stunned. There appeared to be a new grave, and on its tombstone was inscribed, "Tomb of Wudang Sect Hero Song Qingshu."

"It seems the damage to his brain can't be healed," Zhang Wuji said.

He saw Zhou Zhiruo avert her gaze. Zhao Min, after a moment of hesitation, approached Zhou Zhiruo and embraced her without a word.

Zhang Wuji picked up some wild plants that had begun to grow on the grave, then bowed respectfully three times before the tombstone.

After walking about a hundred meters from there, they arrived at a large tomb. There was a tombstone with a rather long inscription, containing a familiar verse about Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao. Zhang Sanfeng had added that verse to commemorate Zhang Cuishan and Yin Susu, who would rather die than reveal the whereabouts of Xie Xun and Tulong Dao.

Unconsciously, tears streamed down all three of their faces. Then they knelt before the tombstone and bowed respectfully. Zhang Wuji, with a trembling voice, expressed his longing for his father and mother.

It appeared the tomb was regularly cleaned. Judging by its condition, someone must have visited it recently and cleared the wild plants growing around it.

From there, they proceeded to the sect founded by Zhang Sanfeng and were greeted by Wudang disciples practicing kung fu. Ming Yue rushed to report their arrival to Zhang Sanfeng. After greeting all his martial uncles, Zhang Wuji led Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min to his grand-master's meditation room, accompanied by Ming Yue.

Zhang Sanfeng looked remarkably healthy for over a hundred years old. There were no signs of senility. His voice was still clear and strong as before. His back was still straight. Apparently, he was enjoying warm tea on the veranda, outside his simple meditation room, while gazing at the wild nature around him and reading a scripture.

Seeing their arrival, he was overjoyed. He put the scripture he was holding into his robe's pocket, then gestured for those kneeling to rise immediately.

However, Zhao Min quickly said, "Several years ago, *Xiao Nuzi*[^xiao-nuzi] acted impertinently and too boldly before Zhang Zhenren. *Xiao Nuzi* truly couldn't distinguish right from wrong and recklessly, ignorantly, tried to shake Mount Tai."

[^xiao-nuzi]: Xiao Nuzi (小女子) is a self-deprecating term used by young women to humble themselves before others.

Hearing this, Zhang Sanfeng burst into laughter and said he never held the matter in his heart. When Zhang Wuji explained that Zhao Min had left her family and was now following him, Zhang Sanfeng observed her intently, then asked, "Young lady, if one day you see your father and my grand-disciple at odds, what will you do then?"

"Xiao Nuzi's experience is very shallow," Zhao Min replied sadly. "During the battle at Shaoshi Peak recently, Xiao Nuzi could only choose not to side with either. One is my father, the other is the man Xiao Nuzi loves. Both Xiao Nuzi loves equally; if one were hurt or killed, Xiao Nuzi's heart would be utterly broken. Zhang Zhenren, please enlighten Xiao Nuzi."

Zhang Sanfeng took a deep breath, then closed his eyes. A moment later, he said while writing something with a dry twig on the ground, "Try to contemplate the meaning of this character throughout your life. If you truly meditate on it every day, I can promise you, you will not be disappointed later."

All three of them saw that the character Zhang Sanfeng wrote was '空' (kōng), which means 'Empty' or 'Void'[^kong].

[^kong]: 'Kong' (空) or 'Empty' in Mandarin, has often been used by Taoist priests throughout history as an object of contemplation.

Zhao Min pondered it for a moment, then kowtowed three times, pressing her forehead to the ground, saying, "Xiao Nuzi will forever remember this teaching of Zhang Zhenren."

Zhang Sanfeng asked again, "I hear the situation outside is very chaotic right now. Wars are happening everywhere. What will you do about this?"

Zhao Min replied, "Whether it's the government's side or the rebels' side, besides fighting each other, they also fight amongst themselves within their own camps. Xiao Nuzi has decided not to side with any camp. If an event occurs before my eyes, only then will Xiao Nuzi know how to act."

Once again, Zhang Sanfeng gazed intently at Zhao Min after hearing that answer. After a moment, he finally said, "Young lady, you are still very young, but you can perceive such things. A girl like you is truly rare in this world."

Zhou Zhiruo, who was kneeling beside Zhao Min, said, "Zhiruo has committed many evils and forgotten Zhang Zhenren's kindness all this time. Zhiruo has disappointed Zhang Zhenren, and is now ready to accept punishment."

Zhang Sanfeng looked at her, frowning. "Why should I punish you?" he asked.
