# Prologue
## *Shaolin, 1355: The Bloodstained Monastery*

The swirling dust gradually dissipated, the bloodstains that marred the grandeur and tranquility of Shaolin Monastery had been cleansed, and slowly everything had returned to normal. No trace remained of the fierce battle and thrilling drama that had ultimately left everyone astonished.

Zhou Zhiruo, who had surprised everyone with her decisive early moves in the fight, until she successfully defeated the three Great Shaolin Monks, was soundly defeated by the beautiful and graceful Girl in Yellow Robes. The question remaining in everyone's minds was perhaps, 'who exactly is this girl in yellow robes?' Unfortunately, only various conjectures arose thereafter, without certainty, except that they had once heard Shi Hongshi affectionately call her 'Yang Jiejie'.

After that, they all also saw Zhou Zhiruo, now terrified, screaming as if she had seen a ghost, and many people chased after her to offer help. Sadly, they had not yet returned.

Outside Shaolin, still around Shaoshi Peak, a few days later, another drama had just concluded between a few young girls and Zhang Wuji.

Yin Li, who was previously thought by everyone to have died, suddenly appeared, as if manifesting from the darkness, healthy and alive, not a ghost as Zhou Zhiruo had imagined.

Now the mystery of the ghost had passed, and Yin Li finally chose to leave, leaving various questions in the minds of the other three people present. They all thought Yin Li had gone mad.

But Zhang Wuji thought, "Perhaps she is a little confused, and it's all because of me. But compared to everyone who considers themselves sane, she might not necessarily be unhappier."

Conversely, Zhao Min had other thoughts. Yin Li was gone, but what about Zhou Zhiruo? Yin Li did not die, Xie Xun was also found, healthy and well. The Martial Arts Scripture within Yitian Jian, along with the military strategy book within the Dragon Slaying Saber, and the saber itself, had all been found and returned to Zhang Wuji. In short, it seemed that all of Zhou Zhiruo's cruel actions and other wrongdoings were now no worse. Although Song Qingshu did indeed kill Mo Shenggu because of her, that was Song Qingshu's own fault; Zhou Zhiruo did not even know about it at all. Furthermore, she certainly did not conspire in that accident. Zhang Wuji had previously been engaged to her, and she was clearly not one to disregard trust and loyalty.

Zhou Zhiruo stood up. "Let's go!" she said.

"Where?" asked Zhao Min.

Zhou Zhiruo replied, "Back at Shaolin, I saw Zhang Zhong rush to find him," she turned her face to Zhang Wuji. "It seems something very important has happened within the Ming Jiao."

Zhao Min smiled at Zhang Wuji and said in a comforting tone, "Yin Li has gone, chasing the Prince from her Fairytale Land in her mind. But there's still me and Zhou Jiejie, who will accompany you to build your own Fairytale Land."

Zhou Zhiruo glared at her, then snorted and asked, "What do you mean by that?"

"Nothing," Zhao Min replied lightly. "People say I boast a lot, my words are nonsense, so just ignore it."

Zhang Wuji's heart grew cold. "I must not neglect Ming Jiao's affairs because of women," he thought, then he hastily said, "Let's quickly find out what happened!"

On their way to the Ming Jiao encampment, a million thoughts swirled in Zhang Wuji's mind. They had experienced warfare themselves, though brief, it was very tense, and he had led that war. Everyone was now boasting about him. He wondered, in his heart, he did not feel the pride he should have felt. Instead, there were a series of sentences from Chaghan Temur, whom he seemed to have just defeated —

At this point, he suddenly thought, something was wrong here, it felt like their victory was a little too easy. He couldn't explain why he thought this. Was Chaghan Temur deliberately losing?

He remembered his words again, "I myself would rather die by your hand than have to kill you, because — it's come this far — now I see you as my son-in-law, which means my own child..."

He was very surprised to realize his own thoughts. At that time, he had been moved by Chaghan's explanation, but for some reason, he had never taken it too seriously. After all, Zhao Min, however beautiful and kind she was, was still just a little girl no more than thirteen years old!

But then he remembered Chaghan Temur's earlier words:

"My ancestors came from the Naiman tribe," Chaghan Temur said. "Finally Genghis Khan conquered our tribe, and since then we have merged with Mongolia, and become 'Mongolians'. Originally, my ancestors lived in Xinjiang. After Kublai Khan founded this Yuan Dynasty, they moved to Henan. Well, I myself was born in Henan. So how can you say that I oppose the people of Zhongyuan? Tell me, if you drive me out, where do you want me to go? I was born in Zhongyuan, so for me, my homeland is Henan! You want to drive me out of my own birthplace?"

Something seemed to strike Zhang Wuji's mind, but at this moment he couldn't explain exactly what, and where exactly Chaghan Temur's words had disturbed his heart. He again remembered his words, which at that time were truly real, patient, as if speaking to his own child:

"Wuji," Chaghan Temur said again. "To change laws, one must indeed overthrow the state and rebuild it. Another way we can take is to enter the government as officials. But most people who enter eventually become corrupt and drown in political games for power and wealth, then forget their original purpose for joining. Therefore, the simplest thing we can do, if we don't want to be directly involved, is to manage our own territory well. If you live in Kaifeng, manage Kaifeng well. If in Jiangnan, manage that place well. If the current laws we feel are biased in favor of one party, there are still many ways to help the people and create justice. For me, nothing is worse than a territory without law and without government. People will become savage, then do as they please, and finally the strongest person there will rule. In other words — usually — they are bandits. This is precisely what is happening in many places now. Isn't it very sad if our once peaceful home suddenly turns into a den of thieves after the arrival of some people who say they came to help the people? Do you know why I rarely appear in the Assembly Meeting? Because that's where all the big criminals are entrenched! As soon as I set foot there, people immediately twist what I do, turning it to their own advantage, I'm lucky if I avoid the misfortune of becoming a criminal. That's why I finally felt unable to do anything beyond my own sphere of influence. If you ask about Ruyang, then I can answer it, but about other areas, I will say I don't know." He looked at Zhang Wuji intently before asking, "Where were you born?"

At that time, he answered truthfully, that he was born on Binghuo Dao. That name was given by his mother, because they didn't know the island's real name. Could it be that the island had no name at all? What was clear, as Chaghan Temur had guessed at the time, was that it was very far north, near Siberia!

This meant that, compared to Chaghan Temur, he truly felt not a native of Zhongyuan, even though both his parents were from here and were born here. It was a stark contrast to Chaghan Temur himself.

While daydreaming and walking quickly, he felt his left hand gently held by Zhao Min, without saying anything. Perhaps the little girl already knew he was daydreaming. He turned to her with a faint smile, without saying anything.

Suddenly they saw a crowd of villagers busy discussing news, and it seemed to be very serious news. Some of them clenched their fists in the air and shouted. Their ears caught a name that sounded very familiar: 'Han Shantong'.

Zhang Wuji invited the two girls to stop for a moment and listen carefully from a distance.

"He's dead!" said one of the farmers. "Immediately executed after being captured!"

"Where did you hear that?" asked another.

"I just heard about Han Shantong," replied the first person. "I was actually busy looking for news after hearing about Han Lin'er's enthronement as Emperor! Think about it, how could his son ascend the throne if Han Shantong was still alive?"

His statement was clearly immediately accepted by everyone, as it made sense.

"Then where did you hear the news of Han Lin'er's enthronement itself?" asked another person who still didn't believe it.

"You can see the announcement at the village hall if you still don't believe it," the farmer replied again. "About this, I heard it directly from our Village Chief. Do you think he's lying? If you ask where he heard it from, I don't know."

At this point, Zhang Wuji immediately urged the two girls to quicken their pace to the Ming Jiao encampment.

"That must be true," he said.

Shaoshi, July 11, 1355: Guo Zixing and Zhu Yuanzhang
Upon returning to the encampment, they were immediately greeted by Zhang Zhong and Fan Yao. But Zhang Wuji immediately asked, "The news about Han Shantong and Han Lin'er... is it true?"

The expressions on both their faces immediately changed drastically. Fan Yao said, "We were all too busy with the Shaolin affair, so no one heard the news about Han Shantong's capture. We also just heard about Han Lin'er's enthronement."

Zhang Wuji sighed deeply and sadly. Han Shantong was a leader he greatly respected. But when he was about to ask something, Fan Yao spoke again, "Jiaozhu, there was just news that one of the leaders of Hongjin Qiyi, Guo Zixing, has passed away. Will we come to pay our last respects? His body is currently in Chuzhou."

"Isn't Guo Zixing a good friend of Peng Dashi? Of course we will come," Zhang Wuji replied, for a moment forgetting about Han Shantong and Han Lin'er.

Fan Yao smiled, then said again, "Not only a good friend of Peng Yingyu, he is also Zhu Yuanzhang's father-in-law. And currently Zhu Yuanzhang is awaiting the birth of his first child."

Zhang Wuji was surprised, and at the same time delighted. He laughed and said, "That's incredible! So Zhu Dage is Guo Zixing's son-in-law? When did he get married?"

"Guo Zixing has an adopted daughter named Ma Xiuying, she is the one who married Zhu Yuanzhang," Fan Yao replied.

"Very interesting," Zhao Min interjected. "Does that mean all of Guo Zixing's forces now fall into Zhu Yuanzhang's hands?"

Fan Yao sensed a faint cynical tone in her voice. And he smiled, saying, "Junzhu is right."

"Doesn't Guo Zixing have sons?" Zhang Wuji asked.

"Yes, their names are Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou," Fan Yao said, scratching his head. "Hmm, it seems they both have a bit of trouble with Zhu Yuanzhang. Indeed, this leadership issue must be decided directly by Han Lin'er, or more precisely Liu Futong."

"Isn't...?" Zhang Wuji asked, but then he immediately realized the problem.

By inviting Zhang Wuji to attend Guo Zixing's funeral, Fan Yao subtly wanted to say that there was an internal conflict in the family, and hoped that Zhang Wuji would help resolve it. Zhao Min had guessed the problem from the start. Zhang Wuji seemed to remember something. He approached Zhang Zhong and asked in a somewhat mysterious tone, "Zhang Daozhang, do you have any other news for me?"

Without waiting for Zhang Zhong's answer, he hastily pulled the Taoist priest's sleeve to move a few steps away, and the others only saw them whispering without being able to hear what they were talking about.

After listening carefully, Zhang Wuji seemed satisfied, then patted Zhang Zhong's shoulder with a beaming face, then said a few more words, and they only heard, "No, this time you still have to do it yourself... Shuobude Dashi still has something else to take care of."

Hearing his name mentioned, Shuobude exchanged glances with Fan Yao, raising both hands as a sign of not understanding. Zhao Min's and Zhou Zhiruo's brows furrowed slightly, indicating they were thinking hard, trying to guess.

But then they saw Zhang Zhong immediately leave, and only waved from afar to say goodbye.

Actually, from the moment they arrived, all the high-ranking officials of the Ming Jiao were surprised to see Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo with Zhang Wuji, but they did not dare to say anything. The two girls, quite far apart in age, seemed harmonious and friendly, even though they had previously fought fiercely over Zhang Wuji's love. In their hearts they thought, "How did Jiaozhu reconcile these two lionesses? Could Qian Kun Da Nuo Yi also play a role in someone's love life?"

Zhou Zhiruo seemed to dislike the gazes of all the Ming Jiao officials. She immediately took Zhao Min's hand and said, "Meizi, let's sit over there and wait!"

The two then sat side by side, joking on a large mountain rock, somewhat away from the high-ranking Ming Jiao officials.

Zhang Wuji returned to his original spot with light steps. His face looked satisfied and radiant, saying lightly, "Alright, let's immediately depart for Chuzhou to meet Guo Zixing's family."

Zhao Min rejoined, but this time she seemed to be alone. Zhou Zhiruo had apparently disappeared without a trace. "Wuji Gege," she said. "Zhou Jiejie said she didn't want to wait for you. She has important business to finish, but she didn't explain what it was."

Zhang Wuji seemed a little disappointed to hear that, but then he smiled again and said, "It's alright, that's good too, the Emei Pai disciples have been waiting for her anyway, we should leave now."

That very day, Fan Yao, Shuobude, Zhang Wuji, and Zhao Min departed for Chuzhou. Along the way, Fan Yao and Shuobude recounted that Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou had always been hostile towards Zhu Yuanzhang from the beginning, and always wanted to kill him. They were afraid that Zhu Yuanzhang's military strength would be stronger than theirs, and then turn against them. Before this, Guo Zixing had successfully controlled Haozhou, but because he was constantly at odds with Sun Deya, he was forced to leave Haozhou and move to Chuzhou, which Zhu Yuanzhang had managed to control.

Guo Zixing had indeed previously saved Zhu Yuanzhang's life before Zhu Yuanzhang joined Hongjin Qiyi. At that time, Zhu Yuanzhang, dressed as a monk, seemed very suspicious to the city guards in Haozhou, but in Guo Zixing's eyes, his appearance was very impressive. He told the guards who had arrested Zhu Yuanzhang to immediately release his bonds and let him join the Hongjin Qiyi fighters he led. At that time, Zhu Yuanzhang's fighting spirit greatly impressed Guo Zixing, and he later married his adopted daughter, Ma Xiuying, to Zhu Yuanzhang.

"So at that time Zhu Dage was no longer a monk?" Zhang Wuji asked.

Zhao Min burst out laughing. "Being Guo Zixing's son-in-law is certainly more interesting than being a monk," she said.

"Guo Zixing was indeed a tough leader at the time," Shuobude said. "But he wasn't the only leader of Hongjin Qiyi; there were many other stronger leaders than him. But anyway, after that, Zhu Yuanzhang always followed wherever Guo Zixing went. He was the first to realize that Sun Deya intended to betray Guo Zixing, and informed his father-in-law about it. But unfortunately, Guo Zixing did not listen to his advice."

"What happened?" Zhang Wuji asked curiously.

"Sun Deya captured Guo Zixing," Shuobude said. "It was then that Guo Zixing realized that Zhu Yuanzhang was right. Next, Zhu Yuanzhang managed to save Peng Da and Guo Zixing. Unexpectedly, Guo Zixing then wanted revenge and captured Sun Deya, but at that time Zhu Yuanzhang was captured by Sun Deya's men. Because of this, Guo Zixing was forced to exchange Sun Deya to free Zhu Yuanzhang, and this made him dissatisfied. He even began to feel wrong about keeping Zhu Yuanzhang. Several times he wanted to attack Zhu Yuanzhang, but then canceled his intention. This made him feel wavering and very stressed. One could say he died from mental pressure."

"A huge advantage for Zhu Yuanzhang," Zhao Min said again, eating the peanuts she had shelled, discarding the shells to the side of the road, laughing coldly, before continuing, "I guess every day he deliberately acted disrespectful, giving his father-in-law more mental pressure."

The journey from Henan to Chuzhou was not too long; they arrived in a few days. On the first day, Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min, who had not had time to rest, took time after lunch to sleep for two hours at the inn, then they quickly continued their journey.

When they arrived in Chuzhou, they saw three coffins in the mourning hall. From the guests, they heard stories that Guo Zixing's two sons had just died in battle with the Yuan forces led by a traitor, Chen Yexian. However, they had managed to defeat the Yuan forces in that battle.

Zhao Min whispered to the other three, "We arrived too late."

The four of them did not talk much with Zhu Yuanzhang and his family, given the mournful atmosphere, and at that time there were many visitors. Guo Zixing's family was highly respected there. After paying their last respects to the three deceased in front of the coffins, they immediately left the house and headed to a tavern to rest for a while.

"Where is this Chen Yexian now?" Zhang Wuji asked as they walked out.

Shuobude shook his head, sighing. "He's dead," he said. "It's unknown who killed him. His body was found in the bushes, outside Haozhou. A guest just told me."

Zhang Wuji, glancing at Zhao Min, saw that the corners of her lips seemed to smile, but she was not actually smiling. He immediately asked, "Under whose command was Chen Yexian previously?"

"About this, does it even need to be asked?" Zhao Min said as she stepped into the tavern, without intending to explain the sentence.

The tavern was quite crowded. Because Zhao Min and Zhang Wuji had not slept enough the previous night, they now felt quite tired. They ordered a lot of food to overcome their fatigue. Seeing the two young people eat heartily, Fan Yao and Shou Bude laughed. Fan Yao noticed that in the past few years, Zhao Min had grown taller and looked more athletic. She was currently not yet fourteen years old. Her age difference was quite significant compared to Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo. But because she was used to leading many people at a very young age, this age difference was often obscured, plus her tall posture also gave the impression that she was more mature than her actual age. Only if one observed from very close up would they realize that Zhao Min was actually still young.

Near their table, there were some people who also seemed to have just returned from Guo Zixing's residence. They were all young men who had just joined Guo Zixing's army. Because their conversation was quite loud, Zhang Wuji and the others could hear it clearly.

"Alas, who would have thought that bastard named Chen finally managed to kill Guo Gongzi," said one stout man with a round face. "But in the end, we still won, that bastard died."

"That's right, fortunately, Zhu Dashuai was vigilant, he had intended to kill Zhu Dashuai before," said his small companion, with a large mole near his nose.

Zhang Wuji and his three companions exchanged glances. After the young men left the tavern, Fan Yao said, "Junzhu's guess was really accurate!"

Zhang Wuji stared at Zhao Min intently, surprised. "How did you know this was Zhu Yuanzhang's plan?"

Zhao Min laughed and said, "Zhang Jiaozhu still doesn't understand human hearts. Do you think Zhu Yuanzhang is as kind as you? Here, no one feels there is enmity between Zhu Yuanzhang and his two brothers-in-law. This means that Zhu Yuanzhang deliberately did not act hostile towards them, even though Guo Tianyou and Guo Tianxu clearly always intended to get rid of him. If next time you find that one of them falls in love with Ma Xiuying, don't be surprised."

"This... what's the connection...?" Zhang Wuji asked.

Zhao Min clicked her tongue impatiently. "Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou clearly always wanted to eliminate Zhu Yuanzhang out of jealousy. After Zhu Yuanzhang appeared, Guo Zixing gave him full support, and even married his adopted daughter to Zhu Yuanzhang. If you are always around people who want to kill you, can you truly be kind to them? That's all just pretense, of course. As soon as there's an opportunity, Zhu Yuanzhang would certainly get rid of them."

"And that opportunity was...?"

"That opportunity was Chen Yexian defecting to their side!"

Zhang Wuji was surprised. "Wasn't Chen Yexian defecting to the government's side?"

Zhao Min shook her head. "If government people defect to the rebels, we must have heard about it often lately. But someone from Guo Zixing's side defecting to the government's side, I'm sure that's very rare. Specifically, Chen Yexian was originally from the Yuan Dynasty, and defected to Guo Zixing's side with the aim of spying on them, but apparently Zhu Yuanzhang smelled his intention, so he intended to kill Zhu Yuanzhang, but failed. Zhu Yuanzhang then saw this as an opportunity to get rid of the Guo brothers, and deliberately left Chen Yexian there without exposing his identity. As soon as there was an attack from the Yuan Dynasty, he took advantage of that opportunity. It was clear that Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou led the troops, and when they were cornered, Zhu Yuanzhang remained silent. After the two men died, he then finished off Chen Yexian, and led his army to win the war. That way, people only saw Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou die on the battlefield, and not because of a personal dispute with Zhu Yuanzhang."

Shuobude and Zhang Wuji were stunned to hear that explanation, but Fan Yao had understood it all along.

Zhang Wuji said, "I must marry you soon to recruit all your father's soldiers."

Zhao Min laughed and said, "Are you sure you can do that? My father certainly wouldn't allow it, the proof is he even chased me away! Right now, only I can marry you quickly to take over all the Ming Jiao members from your hands. Believe me, you can't beat me."

Fan Yao burst into laughter seeing the scene. This dangerous joke could make everyone who had suspected Zhao Min from the start even more suspicious, but it was delivered casually, and at the same time with a very elegant style.

"We must admonish Zhu Yuanzhang," Zhang Wuji said. "Why haven't I seen Chang Yuchun and Xu Da all this time?"

Zhao Min smiled. "People like Chang Yuchun and Xu Da," she said, "must be annoyed seeing Zhu Yuanzhang's theatrics. That's why they kept far away so they wouldn't hear Zhu Yuanzhang's crying."

In his heart, Zhang Wuji laughed. He still remembered how loudly Zhu Yuanzhang cried in front of Guo Zixing's, Guo Tianxu's, and Guo Tianyou's coffins earlier. Xu Da and Chang Yuchun were honest people who always spoke their minds; they disliked all such false politeness, so it made perfect sense for them to deliberately stay away.

Shuobude said, "Jiaozhu, perhaps we should immediately send someone to inform Liu Futong of this development, so he can decide who will lead Guo Zixing's forces next."

At that moment, Zhou Zhiruo suddenly appeared in the tavern and went directly to their table. She said, "I don't think that's necessary, I have investigated this issue along the way, and my conclusion is the same." She had heard their conversation because they were sitting near the window. "Zhang Jiaozhu is here, why do you have to report to Liu Futong?"

"Zhou Guniang!" Fan Yao and Shou Bude greeted, somewhat surprised to see her appearance.

"Just now I saw Zhu Yuanzhang call Xu Da and Chang Yuchun to talk privately. I think he has read your plans, so you'd better act fast," Zhou Zhiruo continued. "I have also sent some Emei male disciples to Peach Blossom Island to retrieve the damaged Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao, perhaps you want to keep them. After all, both weapons are highly respected symbols in the martial arts world. I hope this small contribution can help the Ming Jiao's struggle."

Zhang Wuji saw that Zhou Zhiruo still felt guilty for what she did on Snake Island. Unconsciously, he reached for Zhou Zhiruo's hand to comfort her. But Zhou Zhiruo immediately pulled her hand away, her face reddening.

"You really didn't need to do that," Zhang Wuji said. "But since you've already sent people, we will try to repair both weapons. I think Wu Jingcao can do it, he's a great blacksmith. After that, you can keep Yitian Jian at Emei, and we will keep Tulong Dao."

Zhao Zhiruo seemed somewhat shy, then said again, "Even so, I think I'll trouble you a bit to deliver the repaired Yitian Jian to Emei, and hand it over to Jingxuan Shijie, she is currently the head of Emei."

They were very surprised to hear that statement. Zhang Wuji said, "Isn't...?"

Zhou Zhiruo shook her head, and again said, "I have resigned from my position as head. Besides, I never wanted to accept it in the first place. But at Wan'an Si, Shifu forced me, so I had no other choice."

Zhao Min glanced at Zhang Wuji with a look as if to say, "Look, even Zhou Zhiruo can refuse a position, while you cannot."

"We'd better quickly meet Zhu Yuanzhang again, otherwise, he will find a way to evade us," Zhou Zhiruo said again.

"Right," Zhang Wuji said. "Let's go!"

"...informed leader rather than a manipulated one:"

This actually started long before, when he returned from Snake Island.

When they arrived at Guo Zixing's residence, Zhu Yuanzhang was back attending to the mourners in front of the coffins, and they did not see Xu Da and Chang Yuchun. Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's heavily pregnant wife, was busy attending to guests beside her husband. As many people were still arriving to pay their last respects to Guo Zixing, they did not want to disturb, and simply sat with other guests, enjoying the refreshments provided.

Zhao Min unashamedly sampled the sweet cakes made by Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's wife. Zhou Zhiruo, who had been an expert in cooking since childhood at Emei, noticed that these small foods were mostly made from rice flour and wheat. The method of making them was quite unique and somewhat different from the snacks she usually made for Miejue Shitai at Emei.

Miejue Shitai indeed loved Zhou Zhiruo's cooking very much, but would sternly scold her if she spent too long in the kitchen. After she grew up, Miejue Shitai always supervised her training more strictly. But because Zhou Zhiruo was naturally talented at making food, she would still set aside a good amount of time in the kitchen. The pressure from Ding Minjun, who was jealous of her master always favoring Zhou Zhiruo, deliberately asking her to make difficult dishes, was actually very challenging for Zhou Zhiruo.

They took the opportunity when the number of guests dwindled, then greeted Zhu Yuanzhang and other members of Guo Zixing's family. Guo Tianxu's and Guo Tianyou's mother was also present, and bowed respectfully upon seeing Zhang Wuji. Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's pregnant wife, also bowed. Upon seeing Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min, she assumed the two women were Zhang Wuji's wives, then politely bowed to both of them and greeted, "Please forgive us, Furen, there have been so many people coming since earlier, so we couldn't serve Furen properly."

[^dasao]: Da Sao (大嫂) = older brother's wife / sister-in-law.

Blushing, Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min quickly stopped her from bowing. "Dasao[^dasao] no need to be like this," Zhou Zhiruo said gracefully. "We are both not Jiaozhu Furen." Both immediately introduced themselves as Zhang Wuji's friends with red faces.

Seeing this, Ma Xiuying began to understand. Wisely, she did not ask further about the relationship between Zhang Wuji and the two of them.

At that moment, without wasting any more time, Shuobude asked, "Zhu Yuanzhang, why did you not capture Chen Yexian alive, and instead killed him immediately?"

Zhu Yuanzhang was surprised, but a moment later he replied, "Dashi, at that time during the battle, Zaixia did not know who killed him."

"But you knew before that he was a former government official, didn't you?" Fan Yao asked sharply.

At that moment, Zhao Min saw Ma Xiuying trembling, staring intently at her husband, and although only for a second, she managed to see a faint signal from Zhu Yuanzhang. Zhou Zhiruo, who also saw this, immediately took Zhao Min's hand, then said to Ma Xiuying, "Dasao, we have been wanting to ask how Dasao made those sesame-sprinkled cakes, we liked them very much. Perhaps Dasao could tell us how."

The two of them invited Ma Xiuying to sit in another room.

Zhang Wuji said to Zhu Yuanzhang after the three women left, "Zhu Dage, we should talk in another room."

---

Zhu Yuanzhang led them to a smaller, empty room. After Zhu Yuanzhang closed the door, Fan Yao spoke again, "Zhu Yuanzhang, recite the third main rule of the Ming Jiao!"

Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice but to recite what he had memorized, "Ming Jiao members are strictly forbidden from fighting each other, let alone killing fellow members."

"Good!" said Fan Yao. "Then why did you kill Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou?"

"Fan Yaoshi, Zaixia did not kill them," Zhu Yuanzhang replied. "They died on the battlefield."

"It's true you didn't kill them with your own hands," Shuobude said. "But you deliberately arranged for them to lead on the front lines, and you did nothing to support them. You also led your subordinates to do the same — Jian Si Bu Jiu[^jian-si-bu-jiu] — this is tantamount to murder!"

[^jian-si-bu-jiu]: The Chinese idiom Jian Si Bu Jiu (见死不救, or in traditional characters: 見死不救), which literally means 'seeing someone about to die but doing nothing'. This is equivalent to euthanasia.

Hearing this, Zhu Yuanzhang quickly knelt before Zhang Wuji, then said with tears streaming down his face, "Jiaozhu, please have mercy — what Shuobude Dashi said is true, but from the beginning, Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou always wanted to kill Zaixia. In this matter, Zaixia truly had no other choice. If Jiaozhu considers Zaixia guilty, then Zaixia can only accept a fitting punishment. But Zaixia knows Jiaozhu is very wise, and not one to punish arbitrarily."

Meanwhile, in another room, Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo gently took Ma Xiuying's pregnant hand, then invited her to sit comfortably in a chair. When the woman again tried to bow to them, Zhao Min quickly stopped her and said, "Dasao, we know what Dasao is worried about. But believe us, Zhang Jiaozhu is not someone who acts without consideration. It's just that actions like this must not happen again."

Ma Xiuying sobbed and stammered, "I tried... to stop him... This has happened several times... several times... I mean he... my husband tried to warn them several times... But they always wanted to kill him... In the end, he had no other choice..."

Zhou Zhiruo gently said, "Dasao, in this world, no human has never made a mistake. Xiaomei and Zhao Meizi also made mistakes, and even Zhang Jiaozhu did too. But if Jiaozhu simply allowed what Zhu Dage did, without doing anything, then great chaos would follow. Many people would imitate him, and arbitrarily kill those they disliked, or kill each other without caring about rules anymore. But Xiaomei is confident that Zhang Jiaozhu will still forgive this action. Nevertheless, if Xiaomei may ask Dasao to cooperate with us to prevent the same incident from recurring. Wouldn't this be very good? As women, Xiaomei feels this is the best action we can take, right?"

Hearing Zhou Zhiruo's words, Ma Xiuying seemed calmer. But a moment later she rose from her chair, then wanted to kneel to bow. Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min again stopped her, and helped her back to her seat. "Miss Zhou, Miss Zhao," Ma Xiuying said. "In these cruel times, it is truly rare to meet people like you. I know you two are very close to Jiaozhu. Next time, I, being foolish, will surely need much advice from both of you. I know my husband can sometimes be uncontrollable, but I also know he genuinely cares about the people's interests. I beg you to understand his actions this time."

Zhao Min said, "Dasao, as long as we know what's happening, next time we will surely be able to help Dasao prevent such actions from occurring."

She knew that from now on, they would hear more often from Ma Xiuying. And this woman was a good ally. This way, at least they would be able to control Zhu Yuanzhang's actions.

The two of them continued to accompany Ma Xiuying in the room, chatting about the food recipes Zhou Zhiruo had asked about.

Zhang Wuji intended to help Zhu Yuanzhang, who was still kneeling without daring to look at him, to stand up. But both Fan Yao and Shuobude signaled him not to do so.

Instead, Fan Yao said sharply, "Zhu Yuanzhang, you know Jiaozhu is kind and does not punish arbitrarily, and you deliberately want to take advantage of his kindness to save yourself?"

"Zaixia does not dare," Zhu Yuanzhang replied without lifting his head to look at Fan Yao.

"Now tell me, for this kind of mistake, how should you be punished?" Fan Yao asked again.

Zhu Yuanzhang knew that this rule was set by Zhang Wuji, and whoever violated it would be expelled from the Ming Jiao. In the past, before Zhang Wuji led, such a violation would result in death penalty or the amputation of a limb. But although Hongjin Qiyi, led by his father-in-law, was a branch of Ming Jiao, their teachings were not truly the same. Nevertheless, if he argued with Fan Yao at this moment, it was not impossible that Fan Yao would impose a heavier punishment, and Zhang Wuji would agree, whereas if he was expelled from the Ming Jiao, he would naturally lose all the soldiers he had painstakingly gathered, and could not dream of taking over the leadership of all Guo Zixing's forces. Therefore, he hastily knocked his forehead three times on the floor and said, "Zaixia can only accept whatever punishment Jiaozhu imposes."

Actually, Zhu Yuanzhang was unwilling to accept the fact that he had to submit to Zhang Wuji, whom he had known since childhood. Although he felt that Zhang Wuji understood nothing, his kung fu was very high, no one could match him; this was a fact he had to accept. Besides, let alone ordinary Ming Jiao members, even Han Shantong, Xu Shouhui, and Guo Zixing greatly respected him. If Zhang Wuji wanted to impose the death penalty, then his life would certainly have been lost. Therefore, he humbled himself and made up his mind, then uttered that last sentence. He remained kneeling without raising his head, waiting for Zhang Wuji's decision.

For a moment, Zhang Wuji was in a dilemma. If he did not punish Zhu Yuanzhang, the rules he had set would continue to be ignored, and the same incidents would still occur. But he had known Zhu Yuanzhang since childhood. Besides, it was very reasonable for Zhu Yuanzhang to lead Guo Zixing's forces at this time. He had witnessed the might of the troops under Zhu Yuanzhang's command when they fought at Shaolin. It would be a great loss to expel Zhu Yuanzhang from the Ming Jiao, let alone impose the death penalty just because this person did something that caused Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou to die. After all, those two were also guilty of trying to kill Zhu Yuanzhang several times. Furthermore, Fan Yao had also committed the same transgression by killing a Ming Jiao member to convince Chaghan Temur of his loyalty.

Moreover, he himself was secretly planning a major change that would surely surprise everyone, although at this moment he was not yet sure what he would say to all these Ming Jiao officials. It was precisely someone like Zhu Yuanzhang who would be capable of doing something he himself could not do. This made him think even deeper.

A few seconds later, he stepped forward to help Zhu Yuanzhang stand up, then said, "Zhu Dage, frankly, I am very sad to hear about this incident. Zhu Dage should have reported such a dispute to us, and we would certainly have acted justly. But I do not want this incident to ruin our unity. So I will still allow all the soldiers currently under Zhu Dage's command to remain as they are. However, regarding the remaining soldiers, the Emperor[^emperor-1] will decide. That way, we still uphold the rules, and Zhu Dage will still receive punishment. From now on, Shuobude Dashi will lead this area as supervisor until Han Xiongdi issues an official decision regarding the leadership of the forces. Zhu Dage must report all plans he wishes to carry out to Shuobude Dashi, down to the smallest detail. If Shuobude Dashi does not allow it, it means the action must not be taken. If Dage violates the rules again, then we will certainly impose a heavy punishment. I hope Zhu Dage can accept this decision."

[^emperor-1]: In this case, the Emperor Zhang Wuji refers to is Han Lin'er, who was about to be enthroned as the new Emperor of the Song Dynasty in Bozhou.

[^shouxia]: Shou Xia (手下) = Subordinate or follower.

With sincere heart, Zhu Yuanzhang knocked his forehead on the floor repeatedly, then said, "Shouxia[^shouxia] will obey all Jiaozhu's commands with all my heart. Jiaozhu is truly wise."

With that decision, Shuobude was forced to stay in Chuzhou as a supervisor for the troops and members who were previously under Guo Zixing's leadership. Zhang Wuji, Fan Yao, Zhou Zhiruo, and Zhao Min stayed a few more days at Guo Zixing's family residence to discuss what Shuobude needed to do there.
