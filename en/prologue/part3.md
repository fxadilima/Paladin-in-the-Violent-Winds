# Prologue
## *Wudang, 1355: A Task for Three Young Heroes*

"At the Grand Gathering of Heroes in Shaolin, Zhiruo defied the Wudang heroes and even contributed to Song Dage's misfortune, leading to his death. Furthermore, to uplift Emei's reputation, Zhiruo killed many innocent people," Zhou Zhiruo said with a trembling voice. "At that time, Shifu revealed the great secret of Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao and made Zhiruo swear to carry out her dying wish, and... and deceive Wuji Gege, and seize Tulong Dao... Zhiruo couldn't bring herself to kill... to kill Wuji Gege, but also dared not defy Shifu's command..." She couldn't hold back, and her tears burst forth uncontrollably. At that moment, Zhao Min, who was kneeling beside her, immediately embraced her to comfort her.

Zhang Sanfeng gestured for the three young people to rise and sit on the empty benches before him. He stroked his white beard, lost in deep thought. After a moment, he sighed regretfully and said, "Miejue Shitai was truly unyielding; I never imagined things would turn out like this. But even Guo Xiang Nuxia took decades before finally realizing her mistakes."

He looked at Zhou Zhiruo intently, then said softly, "What you did was wrong, even if you were only following your master's orders. But if you hadn't done it, we wouldn't have known that secret until now." He turned to Zhang Wuji. "I hear you led the forces in Shaolin guided by a scripture inherited from General Yue Fei. That is one significant thing that cannot be overlooked."

"Wuji only managed to emulate the contents of that scripture, and now Wuji has given the scripture itself to someone more worthy of keeping it," Zhang Wuji replied. "Tai Shifu, Wuji is useless, and has disappointed Tai Shifu's hopes. Wuji truly lacks the talent to lead this army. One of the brothers who followed the Red Turban Rebellion, named Xu Da, is far more suited to lead the troops." He took out two copied volumes of the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing and the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms from his pocket and handed them to his grand-master. "Tai Shifu, these are copies of the scriptures whose map was hidden inside Yitian Jian."

Zhang Sanfeng received both scriptures and read their contents for a moment. He then clicked his tongue, saying, "These are two truly extraordinary martial arts. Tai Shifu did once think there was another art, the opposite of the Jiu Yang Shen Gong you learned. At that time, Grandmaster Jueyuan didn't have time to tell me about it. It seems that art was hidden within Yitian Jian. No wonder there was a verse that read, 'If Yitian does not emerge, who can contend with it?' Now we know that verse has a very deep and unexpected meaning."

Zhang Wuji was overjoyed. He said, "Tai Shifu, after discovering that secret, Wuji finally concluded that Tulong Dao itself is merely a symbol; what is called unrivaled is the military power it symbolizes. Whereas Yitian Jian itself is also a symbol, its true meaning being these two scriptures, representing the martial arts world. If that military power is then misused, then someone representing the martial arts world, symbolized by Yitian Jian, will emerge to balance it."

Zhang Sanfeng was silent for a moment, then burst into laughter, saying, "Wuji, for decades Tai Shifu has always contemplated the meaning of that verse, and the secret behind Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao. Today, not only do I get to see the secret contained within those two weapons, but I also get to hear Zhang Cuishan's son elucidate the deepest meaning of that secret itself. It is not in vain that I have lived in this world for over a hundred years. You are still young, yet you can draw such a conclusion—truly extraordinary."

He then turned to Zhou Zhiruo and said, "Events in this world are interconnected. What has passed, let it pass; do not torment yourself regretting it. But Pindao[^pindao] must still say something to you. If you genuinely strive to remove all grudges from your heart, then you will avoid many problems that have already occurred. Jiu Yin Zhen Jing cannot be practiced in haste. You practiced it because you sought revenge, and that is why you ultimately went astray."

[^pindao]: Pindao (贫道) is a self-referential term used by a Taoist priest.

Zhou Zhiruo was deeply moved and intended to rise from her seat to kneel, but Zhang Sanfeng gestured with his hand for her to remain seated. With tears in her eyes, Zhou Zhiruo said, "Zhiruo will surely remember Zhang Zhenren's valuable lesson. But Zhiruo is untalented, and no longer serves as the Emei Sect Leader. Zhiruo humbly requests guidance from Zhang Zhenren."

Zhang Sanfeng shook his head. "Pindao is too old now. Instead, Wuji will guide you to study Jiu Yin Zhen Jing correctly." He turned back to Zhang Wuji, saying, "Tai Shifu hears that right now we have an emperor in Bozhou, and we also have an emperor in the north. What exactly is happening?"

Zhang Wuji sadly recounted everything they had experienced after the battle in Shaolin. He also spoke of Zhu Yuanzhang's actions and Guo Zixing's death in Chuzhou. Hearing the story, Zhang Sanfeng lowered his head in thought. After a long moment, he finally sighed deeply, shaking his head, and said, "Throughout history, the dream of the throne has always corrupted people. But a country indeed cannot be without a leader. Since almost all dynasties are born from rebellion, those who become emperors are also those with military positions, and simultaneously rebels. That is why what you mentioned about the secret of Yitian Jian becomes important. But how will you apply it, so that the common people also benefit?"

"Wuji is very foolish," Zhang Wuji said. "Wuji doesn't know how to apply it; please guide me, Tai Shifu."

Zhang Sanfeng laughed, saying, "You have two excellent colleagues by your side. What more can Tai Shifu do to help you? They can do it much better." He turned to Zhao Min and asked, "Little lady, what do you see regarding this issue of the Ming Cult in the north and south?"

Zhao Min was somewhat surprised by the question, but she replied, "Xiao Nuzi knows that the government is currently busy fighting Zhang Shicheng, and although Toqto'a appears to be winning, his victory is still uncertain, because Xiao Nuzi knows that there is a turmoil currently happening within the palace. It's not impossible that the situation will change drastically. It seems that my father is currently assigned to handle Zhang Shicheng's problem. Conversely, in Xu Shouhui's territory, there is now a Chen Youliang, who, according to Xiao Nuzi, will certainly incite Ni Wenjun to rebel against Xu Shouhui. After that, he will then kill Ni Wenjun with his own hands, on the pretext that Ni Wenjun intended to rebel, thereby being considered a hero. But next, he himself will rebel against Xu Shouhui and seize his throne. Xiao Nuzi dares to make such a guess based on previous experience on Snake Island, when I met Chen Youliang."

Zhang Wuji was very surprised to hear the detailed analysis of Zhao Min. But then he saw his grand-master nod his head happily, then asked, "Wuji, do you understand what Tai Shifu means?"

In truth, Zhang Wuji was still confused and wanted to ask, but at that moment, Zhang Sanfeng had already shifted his attention back to Zhao Min and asked, "And what about the Ming Cult in the east?"

At that moment, Zhou Zhiruo interjected, "Zhang Zhenren, Zhiruo believes that the new Song Dynasty's issue is temporarily safe, because we currently have a good ally."

"Oh?" Zhang Sanfeng was surprised, then asked again, "An ally?"

Zhou Zhiruo recounted their conversation with Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's wife. And she also explained that Ma Xiuying was Guo Zixing's adopted daughter.

Zhang Sanfeng said, "Remarkable, Wuji, you should now understand what Tai Shifu means." He then said to Zhou Zhiruo. "Pindao sees that this Zhu Yuanzhang is actually more dangerous than Chen Youliang. But Pindao sees your reasoning is very sound; in many ways, he will surely listen to his wife's advice. However, you must diligently maintain contact with Ma Xiuying."

Zhang Wuji said, "But how can a wife like Ma Xiuying prevent Zhu Yuanzhang from doing something to Liu Futong and Han Lin'er? Will Zhu Yuanzhang truly listen to her?" He had indeed harbored worries about this for some time. He saw the similarity between Chen Youliang's position and Zhu Yuanzhang's, and both had the same great ambition for power. If Zhu Yuanzhang was allowed to fully control Guo Zixing's forces, then his next target would be to overthrow Liu Futong and Han Lin'er.

"Precisely, that's where our role comes in," Zhao Min said. "We must be able to support Ma Xiuying. But I think for now, Zhu Yuanzhang will still submit to Liu Futong and Han Lin'er, because he wants to appear as a good person. Besides, you just pardoned him, so for now, he won't dare to make the same mistake. Next, Liu Futong will certainly order him to conquer territories currently deemed important, for example, territories that were formerly part of the Southern Song, like Kaifeng."

"I don't think Zhu Yuanzhang will necessarily listen to Liu Futong's orders," Zhang Wuji said. "I feel that right now he views himself as equal to Liu Futong, or even Han Lin'er, meaning free from the obligation to submit to anyone. Previously, Guo Zixing also refused to submit to anyone's orders."

Zhang Sanfeng nodded his head, saying, "Good, now Tai Shifu wants to see how the three of you can work together to alleviate the suffering that the common people must endure due to war, because war is definitely unavoidable." He looked at Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min alternately, then said, "Tai Shifu is very old now; I don't know how long I can accompany you. But in a few months, Yin Liting will have a child, and at that time, Tai Shifu still hopes to meet you all again here. Tai Shifu hopes you can work well together. As martial artists, we are indeed not like generals fighting on the battlefield. Our duty is to help the people and create justice everywhere."

He then said to Zhao Min, "Your biggest problem before was that your teacher taught you no internal energy or qinggong at all. That was because she viewed you as a threat to her struggle. But if you diligently contemplate the meaning of the character I mentioned earlier, then Wuji's guidance will surely make you progress rapidly, because you are actually very talented. If Zhiruo practices the art from Jiu Yin Zhen Jing correctly, then you will be able to practice Taiji and Jiu Yang Shen Gong with Wuji's guidance. In this way, you will surely be able to work well together to help the people from great hardship due to war. If you connect the meaning of the character 'Kong' with your current situation, then you will understand that because you have never been taught internal energy, it is actually an advantage for you. Like a bowl or a cup, if its center is not empty, then the cup cannot be used as a cup."

Zhao Min immediately understood the meaning of that last sentence. When she and Zhou Zhiruo realized the change in how Zhang Sanfeng referred to himself, from 'Pindao' to 'Tai Shifu', they were deeply moved, and unconsciously, their eyes welled up with tears because Zhang Sanfeng mentioned, "I don't know how long I can accompany you." In their hearts, they wondered why Zhang Sanfeng was now calling himself 'Tai Shifu'? Did the old man consider them his grand-disciples?

To Zhang Wuji, Zhang Sanfeng said, "Wuji, from now on, you must guide their training correctly. Tai Shifu is too old, and time is so pressing right now; you must depart immediately to carry out this important task. War has already begun to rage everywhere; we cannot waste time." With this sentence, Zhang Sanfeng was actually indirectly saying that now both Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min must learn kung fu from Zhang Wuji, and that included all the Wudang kung fu that his grand-disciple had learned. Although not officially stated, this meant that Zhang Sanfeng already considered both girls as Wudang disciples and family.

With tears in their eyes, the three bid farewell, then quickly left Wudang to head south.

Zhang Sanfeng watched the backs of the three young people until they disappeared behind the wall. He could see that Zhang Wuji indeed possessed very high kung fu, even higher than what he could achieve at the same age. But his grand-disciple had not inherited the decisiveness of his parents, whereas the two girls did possess it.

With his wealth of experience as a man who had lived for over a hundred years, witnessing the final era of the Song Dynasty, and once considered a strong candidate for a high position under Kublai Khan but later declined it, Zhang Sanfeng now once again witnessed the suffering of the common people due to war. He judged Zhao Min to possess extraordinary intelligence and courage. She was also capable of making important decisions quickly. However, she was not ruthless enough in critical situations. Sometimes, delaying crucial decisions due to hesitation would lead to worse outcomes. Fortunately, Zhou Zhiruo, who appeared gentle and patient on the outside, in desperate situations, was capable of taking necessary drastic actions, even at the risk of being in the wrong. If these three young people could work well together, they would be able to play a significant role for the common people and the martial arts world amidst the great chaos that was sure to erupt in a short time.

War was truly unavoidable. In this regard, the country indeed needed an emperor, but a cruel emperor still needed to be warned. Zhang Sanfeng hoped that the three young people would return to Wudang with good news.


## *Xiangyang, 1355: A Small Incident in Legendary City*

After descending from the Wudang mountains, the first place that came to mind was Xiangyang. It was in this city that the legendary martial arts couple, often spoken of by people and also by Zhang Sanfeng, had fiercely defended its fortress. Tales of Guo Jing and Huang Rong's heroism still resonated to this day. They themselves had recently been involved in events related to the couple's creations—Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao!

"I'm getting excited!" Zhao Min said with a bright face. Her snow-white complexion seemed alive, a faint pink flush clearly indicating her rising spirits under the mild afternoon sun. She appeared lively, like other teenagers her age, just beginning to blossom. "This city could be called the origin of Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao! The legendary weapons that have just claimed so many lives!"

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo watched her antics with a smile. They thought, "No matter how clever this child is, she's still a child. This city is indeed legendary, but it looks like an ordinary city, no different from other cities in Zhongyuan. Not everyone here knows about Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao."

Zhao Min rode ahead of them, entering Xiangyang's sturdy and bustling city gate. This was not surprising, as Xiangyang was the gateway to the southern region of the province after crossing the Han River. At that moment, Zhou Zhiruo's memory was actually more fixed on the Han River than the city itself, because for her, that was where she first met Zhang Wuji, when they were twelve and ten years old respectively. She thought, laughing inwardly, "At that time, this little girl was just born."

They dismounted and strolled around the market, looking at the entertainment venues, which seemed lively even though it was still broad daylight. Usually, these places were crowded at night.

Zhang Wuji asked, "Are you hungry? I want to find something to eat, just to tide us over before dinner."

Zhou Zhiruo shook her head with a smile and said, "I'm not hungry, but I'll still accompany you both."

"I'm hungry!" Zhao Min exclaimed. "Let's find some good food."

Neither Zhang Wuji nor Zhou Zhiruo were surprised. Zhao Min was currently in her growth phase, and she seemed to need more food than other girls her age, considering her diligent martial arts training.

As they were still searching for a modest yet appealing eatery, their attention was drawn to a small commotion between a shop owner and a group of people. The trio approached the shop to see what was happening.

Upon getting closer, they found that the shop sold typical Mongolian food, and judging by their features, the people arguing with the owner also had Mongolian characteristics. This was quite interesting to them.

They heard the shop owner say, "Guanye[^guanye], to my humble knowledge, there's no rule stating that a shop like this cannot serve Han customers. I am merely a merchant; naturally, more customers mean more profit."

"Then you'll surely lose money," one of the soldiers retorted. "Because we won't eat here if you don't drive those people out!"

[^guanye]: Guānyé (官爷) is commonly used in daily conversation when addressing soldiers or low-ranking officials, signifying deference.

The shop owner bowed respectfully, still smiling, and said, "Guanye, please find another place that suits your taste."

With a snort, the soldiers then left to find another establishment.

Such a scene was not particularly strange to them, but at that moment, Zhang Wuji was carefully observing the shop owner's appearance. He felt he couldn't determine whether this person was Mongolian or Han. There was a regulation requiring Han people to wear their own distinct clothing, as did those from the Hui tribe or others, although such regulations were often ignored because, of course, officials or local governments couldn't possibly scrutinize the clothes worn by so many people daily. But the shop owner cleverly wore clothing that had no specific distinguishing features. He also spoke Mongolian fluently when talking to other customers, though he had used a lot of Han language earlier. Nowadays, ordinary Mongolians were also accustomed to speaking Han, and they couldn't be distinguished from others, a clear example being Zhao Min. Nevertheless, Zhang Wuji found this shop owner very intriguing. He became curious about what the Han people eating inside the shop looked like.

Zhang Wuji said, reaching into his pocket, "I suddenly want to eat there."

The two girls beside him looked surprised. Zhou Zhiruo asked, "Why?"

"Just curious," Zhang Wuji replied simply. "I think my money can still cover the cost of food here."

Zhao Min had just sold all the luxurious jewelry she brought, and she also still had a considerable supply of gold ingots to fund their journey. She knew Zhang Wuji didn't carry much money, so she said, "This time, let me pay. Let's go in!"

Upon entering the seemingly luxurious large tent, she immediately scanned the room to see who the soldiers meant by 'those people'. As they sat down at a table prepared for them, her gaze suddenly fixed on a group of people calmly eating a few tables away. The four men were well-built, clearly indicating their martial arts skills were not to be underestimated. And the most interesting person was the fifth, who turned out to be a woman. The woman appeared middle-aged, though not yet fifty. She wore clothes like a female martial artist, blue in color, and before her lay a long sword.

"Ah, so those are the ones the soldiers meant," Zhang Wuji thought.

Suddenly, Zhao Min whispered, "*Huanghou*[^huanghou]."

[^huanghou]: Huanghou (皇后) is the formal term for Empress.

Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji immediately turned to her in surprise. They subtly glanced towards the table Zhao Min indicated with her eyes, and indeed, it was the table occupied by the five people Zhang Wuji had just noticed. He was greatly shocked.

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo had seen two Yuan Dynasty Empresses before, when they visited Dadu and coincidentally there was an Imperial Festival where Zhao Min deliberately staged a puppet show to mock Zhou Zhiruo. But the woman they saw now looked very different. They could, of course, surmise that this woman must be Empress Qi, if Zhao Min was correct. But neither of them could recognize her in this attire.

Under the table, they felt Zhao Min's small hand signaling them not to stare at the table for too long, as it would surely arouse suspicion. Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo immediately understood. They saw a waiter approach with a friendly smile, asking for their order.

Given their shallow knowledge of Mongolian food and drink names, Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo let Zhao Min order whatever she deemed suitable.

Zhao Min ordered Mongolian-style flatbread, along with meat and *airag* for them to share. While the waiter went to prepare their order, Zhang Wuji secretly glanced at the table. His gaze met that of the woman Zhao Min had identified as Empress Qi, and the woman smiled kindly at him. Feeling a little embarrassed, Zhang Wuji returned a slight smile in greeting.

In his heart, he thought, "After she smiled, she looked more like the Empress Qi I saw back then."

The woman in blue seemed to be whispering to one of her companions, and after that, the man rose from his seat and walked towards a group of waiters waiting near the cashier. He said something in a low tone that they couldn't clearly hear from their table. The waiters nodded earnestly, then one of them immediately walked towards a door that seemed to lead to the kitchen.

About ten minutes later, their order arrived. Two cheerful waiters placed all the food from their trays onto their table. Three flatbreads and meat, then *airag*. But when the other waiter was about to place the contents of his tray, Zhou Zhiruo said, "Oh, we only ordered this. That doesn't seem to be our order."

The waiter said kindly, "You three are very lucky. All this food is free; it's a gift from our shop."

"Wow," Zhang Wuji said, surprised. He was about to say something, but the two waiters turned and quickly left.

The contents of the second waiter's tray seemed much more substantial than their own order. There were three large cups of goat milk, various types of small snacks, and fresh fruits.

Zhao Min immediately and unhesitatingly filled the center of her bread with a generous amount of meat, then began to eat with relish, oblivious to those around them. Zhang Wuji, feeling hungry, also followed the girl, starting with a little goat milk before him, then busying himself with the flatbread. They quickly finished the bread without a trace, then began to eye the small snacks, most of which also resembled small breads, likely filled with meat or other ingredients.

Unlike Zhang Wuji, who was tall and muscular, and Zhao Min, who was in her growth phase, Zhou Zhiruo had a small build, and she didn't feel the need for so much food, besides not feeling hungry yet. When she bit into the bread, she felt a sensation she had never experienced before. It had a very distinct aroma, slightly meaty even without any filling. But she still felt she had to struggle a bit to finish the large bread.

She watched Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min eat ravenously and quickly. In less than fifteen minutes, all the food and drink on the table were gone, mostly consumed by the two of them.

Unconsciously, her eyes glanced towards the table where the woman Zhao Min had identified as Empress Qi was sitting with four men, seemingly her personal guards. It turned out the woman was also looking at her intently. She almost lost her composure when she saw the woman smile kindly at her. "Perhaps I misread," she thought. But it was very real. For some reason, she then returned what she judged to be a greeting, also with a smile.

Soon after, they saw the woman stand up, say something in a low tone to her four guards, and they walked towards the cashier, then left the shop.

Feeling full, and seeing that Zhou Zhiruo's bread and milk were also finished, Zhao Min waved to a waiter.

"How much do we owe?" she asked.

The waiter smiled and said, "Everything has been paid for, *Xiaojie* doesn't need to pay anymore."

"Huh? Who paid?"

"The group that just left," the waiter said.
