# Chapter 18
## *Wudang, September 15, 1366: Golden Blooms in Autumn*

Zhou Zhiruo and Yang Buhui worked together, preparing food to celebrate Zhao Min's birthday at Zhang Sanfeng's pavilion. As they carried the food and dining utensils to the spot, everyone present was startled by several secret weapons that swiftly flew past Yang Buhui's left shoulder, heading toward a heavily fruiting lychee tree.

Startled, Zhang Wuji instinctively leaped forward, blocking the sudden attack to protect the two women carrying trays full of food. Several third-generation Wudang disciples quickly placed the trays they were carrying onto the table, swords ready in hand. "Watch out!"

The hoarse voice of an old woman carried on the wind, seemingly filling the air around them. Zhang Wuji's and Yang Buhui's memories were transported back to their childhood, in Butterfly Valley.

Now, an almost identical scene repeated itself. Yang Buhui recognized the secret weapons, made of gold and shaped like flowers. Then, suddenly, as if appearing from behind the clouds, an old woman floated down with a very ugly-faced young girl. The old woman laughed with her hoarse voice. The girl was small, seemingly in her twenties, holding the old woman's left hand, landing softly on the ground, without a sound at all, indicating high-level qinggong.

Yang Buhui slowly began to realize that the girl was, of course, not young Yin Li, although her innocent and unrestrained demeanor felt exactly the same as she said to her grandmother, "*Popo*[^popo], they're all scared."

[^popo]: Popo (婆婆), "Grandma".

"Hmm, good," Jinhua Popo said happily. "That's how it should be."

"Jinhua Popo?" Yang Buhui exclaimed, almost disbelieving. She had heard all the stories from Zhang Wuji about their experiences on Snake Island. Xiao Zhao was previously her servant, but it turned out she was Jinhua Popo's daughter. But it was clear now that Xiao Zhao was already married to Zhang Wuji and even had two children. How was Jinhua Popo still the same as before? And who was that girl?

Zhang Wuji, of course, knew that the golden flower projectiles were not meant to harm anyone. He just smiled faintly, saying nothing.

"*Die*[^die], who is this grandma?" Alessandra asked. "Why does Aunt Yang call her Jinhua Popo?"

[^die]: Die (爹), "Father" or "Dad".

Smiling faintly, Zhao Min clasped her hands together, "Han Furen, how are you?"

Just as Zhou Zhiruo was about to greet her in the same manner, Rut suddenly ran up to Jinhua Popo, looking at her intently from close range, then laughed, asking, "*Laolao*, who are you?"

Very interested, Jinhua Popo then grabbed Rut by the collar behind her neck and lifted her high with just one hand, like lifting a kitten, bursting into laughter, and retorted, "Laolao? Hm! Aren't you afraid of me?"

At this moment, Rut was speaking more fluently, many of her utterances could be understood. She laughed happily again, touching Jinhua Popo's face, answering, "Why should I be afraid?"

Hearing that, Zhang Sanfeng, who had been silent until now, burst into hearty laughter. At that moment, 'Yin Li' said, "Popo, how about we take her to Snake Island?"

"Ah Li, do you like this child?" Jinhua Popo asked. "Or perhaps — you prefer *her father*?"

Suddenly, Ah Luo appeared from behind a tree, laughing heartily. "*Shijie*, that's enough, stop joking! Ah Li now has her own child." She turned to the girl mimicking Yin Li. "You too, don't confuse people."

Jinhua Popo and 'Yin Li' removed their disguises, laughing. The third-generation Wudang disciples looked astonished at their true faces and appearances. Dongfang Yuxian said, "Popo, they already know."

"Of course," Tajkis replied casually, turning to Zhang Wuji. "You dared to leave my daughter and grandchildren alone in Ningxia?"

Bowing respectfully with a smile, Zhang Wuji greeted, "*Yuemu*[^yuemu], how are you? Xiao Zhao isn't alone; there are many people there, and Ah Li also lives there."

[^yuemu]: Yuemu (岳母), "Mother in-law".

Zhao Min punched Dongfang Yuxian's shoulder, slightly annoyed. "You startled me!"

Having adventured with Yin Li in eradicating the officials infiltrated by Bolad Temur in Kaifeng, Dongfang Yuxian could naturally mimic her movements with ease. She just smiled faintly. "*Junzhu* must have known, it was only a matter of time."

The four disciples of Zhang Sanfeng only smiled faintly. They had indeed heard of Tajkis's dual role as Jinhua Popo and also the Purple-Robed Dragon King[^naga-berjubah-ungu] before. That issue was long in the past for them, and they themselves never had any personal problem with Tajkis.

[^naga-berjubah-ungu]: The Purple-Robed Dragon King was one of the Four Dharma Kings of the Ming Cult, whose true identity was Dai Qisi (戴綺絲), or Tajkis. She was Persian and married to Han Qianye (韓千葉), hence also known as Han Furen (韓夫人). Her daughter is Xiao Zhao.

Zhang Sanfeng himself had only heard stories from Zhang Wuji and his other disciples. After meeting Tajkis directly, he was quite impressed. This woman was not at all like the descriptions many people had given before. He could still understand why Tajkis had previously held a personal grudge against Hu Qingniu. Now, that matter was long past. Tajkis was now part of their own family, through Xiao Zhao's marriage to Zhang Wuji. Both before and now, there was no reason for Wudang to be hostile towards Tajkis.

Zhou Zhiruo was slightly troubled earlier, remembering her past ill-treatment of Yin Li, who was Tajkis's direct disciple. She still didn't know how to act, choosing to remain mostly silent.

In contrast, Zhang Wuji, without hesitation, said to their children, "This is also your grandmother — Mama Xiao's birth mother. Aren't you going to greet *Laolao*?"

Except for Rut, who was still watching Tajkis with intense curiosity, the other four children had been stunned since Tajkis revealed her disguise. They immediately saw Tajkis's resemblance to Xiao Zhao, though Tajkis's Persian features were far more pronounced. Alessandra quickly prompted her siblings to bow respectfully, "Laolao!"

"Laolao is very beautiful," Rut said, gently touching Tajkis's face with her small hand.

"Eh, you're also beautiful, like your grandmother," Tajkis said, handing Rut to Ah Luo, who was approaching them. "Ah Luo, this grandchild of yours inherited your courage." She then clasped her hands together to greet Zhang Sanfeng. "*Laonu*[^laonu] was merely joking. *Laonu* hope Zhang Zhenren doesn't mind a little entertainment."

[^laonu]: Laonu (老女), "This old woman".

"Aiyooo, your daughter advancing Ningxia, now that's entertainment for me," Zhang Sanfeng said happily. "You should go there; why are you still roaming in the south?"

"Laonu was shocked when disembarked in Quanzhou; a large-scale massacre was happening," Tajkis explained. "Then Laonu heard about some old acquaintances — ehm... in Jiangnan, this matter is a bit messed up... besides, Laonu also didn't know where to find that silly girl. Only knew she must have married this rascal son-in-law." She laughed freely. "When I arrived in Xiangyang, Laonu finally understood everything. *Shimei*, do you intend to be my rival or my friend now?" She turned to Ah Luo.

"What's the need for rivalry?" Ah Luo said, looking at Rut. "This grandchild of mine is also Shijie's grandchild. Likewise, Dario and Esther are also my grandchildren. All of this is actually the doing of Huang Shang and Zhang Zhenren, besides Shijie's own doing—who told you to go to Persia?"

Zhang Wuji cleared his throat. He felt that if he let them continue, his two mothers-in-law would start discussing things uncomfortable for him. "Yuemu, the Quanzhou issue has actually been partly relocated to Ningxia. Furthermore, Yuemu will surely be greatly needed there. It's just that right now, we must quickly get Aunt Qi out of the palace."

Tajkis laughed. "You truly believe Qi Shimei is crazy?"

Zhou Zhiruo felt a quiet joy within her. It turned out what she had thought before was starting to make sense. She cleared her throat, daring to speak, "It seems Mama feels the same way."

Previously, Tajkis had never liked Zhou Zhiruo. On Snake Island, when Zhou Zhiruo was her captive, she always judged Zhou Zhiruo's actions as suspicious. But now, the term 'Mama' that Zhou Zhiruo had just used felt somewhat sincere to her ears. Her heart began to soften. She smiled kindly, saying, "Qi Shimei has been very clever since childhood — or, more accurately, *cunning*. To me, she has never known hardship; she will surely find a way out of any problem. As soon as I heard about this matter, I felt she was currently playing the biggest *drama* of her life. I'm just not sure what her intention is."

For Zhang Sanfeng, this was something new. He had never considered this possibility at all.

With furrowed brows, Ah Luo said, "To me, there's only one reason for Qi Shimei to do something like that—to force Huang Shang to retreat north. But earlier, she said 'don't touch Ningxia,' which Wang Baobao himself heard! This means she wants to retreat to another place. I think Ding Minjun's action of going to Shangdu was correct. Somehow, this aligns with Qi Shimei's thinking."

"Ding Minjun?" Tajkis's brows furrowed, then she burst into laughter. "You mean Miejue's insolent disciple?" Her laughter grew louder. "I slapped her many times. I think Miejue would surely approve of my actions. But from your account, it seems Qi Shimei managed to conquer that child. Ah Luo, I think the only way to resolve this is for us to enter the palace and take control from within. I believe Huang Shang will listen to Wuji now! That way, we can also bring Qi Shimei out of there."

Hearing "enter the palace," Matteo and Francesco immediately grew interested. Hopeful, Francesco asked, "Laolao can enter the palace?"

"Why not? Your father certainly can too! But if entering the *harem*, I'm the one who can do it," Tajkis explained. "Ah Luo, aren't you actually able to go back in there too?"

"Yes, but I was afraid of messing up Qi Shimei's plan," Ah Luo explained. "After that, I became uncertain if I could leave freely again, because Huang Shang would surely forbid me from going."

For Alessandra, this was new. They had never understood that their father would have difficulty entering the palace harem. She asked, "Laolao, why can't Father enter the harem?"

"Because only eunuchs or women can do it," Tajkis said. "Only Huang Shang himself, a man, can enter the harem."

This was precisely what Zhang Wuji had been thinking earlier, which was why he hadn't said anything about how to free Qi Shengniang. Now Tajkis added a new possibility, that Qi Shengniang was deliberately feigning insanity. His mind began to race, exploring new possibilities to hasten the resolution of the problem.

Zhang Sanfeng suddenly asked, "Wuji, are you brave enough to *take over* the palace now?"

Zhang Wuji currently felt the same way he did years ago when they first set out from Wudang Shan, when he had just become the Ming Cult leader, Xiao Zhao was only about fifteen, and Zhao Min challenged Wudang, no older than twelve. If back then he was bold because he hadn't yet realized the consequences of his actions, now he was facing those consequences. He had to finish what he started, and at the same time, mend the damage done. Speaking of mistakes, he had indeed made too many. Now, his two wives were here, and his two mothers-in-law were ready to help him. What did he have to fear?

"If Yuemu (Mother-in-law) dares, why wouldn't Wuji?" he said, turning to Ah Luo. "I think Yuemu should also return to the palace now. We'll still help Huang Shang overcome his difficulties, even if we eventually leave him."

Yin Liting felt amused inwardly; his nephew had so many 'Yuemu' present at once. If Li Furen were also here, he might get confused on how to differentiate the calls. Only Zhou Zhiruo's mother had passed away. No wonder Zhou Zhiruo now considered Li Furen and Qi Shengniang as her own mothers. Suddenly, an idea sparked in his mind, envisioning what Qi Shengniang had once proposed. He said, "Wuji, why just your mothers-in-law? I think you can take all these children into that chaotic palace. Isn't Yi An truly Huang Shang's grandchild? If you yourself can't freely enter and exit the harem, couldn't they?"

Everyone responded to his suggestion with excitement. Alessandra immediately tugged at Zhang Wuji's sleeve, "Die (Dad), that's right! Take all of us!"

Zhou Zhiruo glanced at Zhao Min, full of questions. They highly doubted whether Yin Liting's suggestion could be implemented. But then Ah Luo said, "You can stay in my room, but don't just wander out to other places. You all definitely need to learn about palace rules first. This will take time, because in the palace, we can't speak carelessly."

Hearing this, Matteo and Francesco's eyes sparkled. Francesco asked hopefully, "Laolao, can we really go into the palace?"

Rut, influenced by her older siblings' excitement, clapped her hands without understanding what was happening, saying, "Laolao, Tai Sh-sh-Yeye can come too? Yi An can come?"

But Avraham murmured, "But *Allah* didn't order father to be emperor..."

Laughing, Zhang Sanfeng sat Rut on his lap, while Zhang Wuji looked at Avraham seriously, saying, "Father won't be emperor; he just wants to help the emperor there. Do you think *Allah* would permit that?"

During his stay in Xiangyang, Avraham often heard Sara and Alya's family stories about Joseph helping Pharaoh in Egypt. This story greatly influenced him. He immediately cheered, "Then *Allah* will surely permit it!"

But Zhao Min was still doubtful, muttering, "How can we enter the palace with so many people...?"

Ah Luo said calmly, "You'd be surprised." Without hesitation, she turned to Dongfang Yuxian. "Yuxian, you also have to come this time. We'll enter the palace and take control of it, then leave after it's done. Let the demons who want power sit there."
