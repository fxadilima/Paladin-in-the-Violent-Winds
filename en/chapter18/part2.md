# Chapter 18
## *Dadu, December 1366: Christmas at the Palace*

After several days of deliberation, Ah Luo, Munashiri, and Ayushiridara reached an agreement on how they'd present the situation to everyone. The letter read by Ah Xiu and Xiao Zhao in Ningxia was sent before this agreement was reached.

The door to Toghon Temur's study was knocked from outside, then Ayushiridara's figure appeared with a wide smile, saying lightly, "Fuhuang (Imperial Father), look who's here. We've been waiting for him for a long time..."

A man appeared from behind the door. He was tall, athletic, with a neatly trimmed beard. Although not very large, for some reason, his figure reminded Toghon of Chaghan Temur.

Zhang Wuji bowed respectfully, placing his right hand on his chest, greeting, "Huang Shang (Emperor)! Zhang Wuji comes to pay his respects."

Immediately rising from his seat and exclaiming with joy, Toghon quickly approached him. A great weight seemed to lift from his shoulders. He's finally here! He came voluntarily! For years, Toghon had secretly wished for this very man to arrive, hoping to finally relinquish the burden of the throne and retreat to Shangdu as Qi Shengniang had hinted. "Haha! You've finally come! Only by yourself? Why didn't you bring your family?"

With full calculation, Ayushiridara said, "Dage (Elder Brother) actually brought the other children, and also both Saosao (sisters-in-law), but they are currently paying respects to Mufei[^mufei]."

[^mufei]: Mufei (母妃) here refers to Ah Luo.

"Ah, tell them all to come here!" Toghon said joyfully.

The spacious study was soon filled with children's voices when Ah Luo and Munashiri came bringing Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min, along with all their children. Rut had indeed been with Toghon for several days, but Zhang Wuji's four other children immediately drew his attention.

Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min bowed respectfully, greeting gracefully, "Hai'er (Your children) pay respects to Huang Shang."

Ah Luo and Munashiri had carefully calculated this form of address, which yielded precisely what they hoped for. Toghon Temur was instantly surrounded by people he trusted as his own family. After so long having lost Qi Shengniang, feeling alienated from Ayushiridara, separated from Lihua and Ah Xiu, he now not only found Rut but discovered a complete family, a place where everything "made sense" to him again. His smile widened further. "You two truly belong here! Minmin, how long has it been since I last saw you?"

With a faint smile, Zhao Min said, "The last time was when Hai'er was twelve years old. Huang Shang gave me a set of bow and arrows, and a very beautiful dagger. Now Hai'er is twenty-four, three children are grown, and another is in Ganzhou with their mother." She gestured for Matteo and Francesco to approach. The two boys bowed, placing their right hands on their chests, mimicking their parents' posture. "Matteo and Francesco are now seven," Zhao Min explained. "They are twins."

Seeing the two boys, who were difficult to tell apart, Toghon Temur laughed. "How do I tell you two apart?"

The two boys grinned widely, using their Han names. "Ziwu is slightly taller," Matteo said.

"Zijian is a bit bigger," Francesco added. He indeed appeared sturdier than his brother, though slightly shorter.

Pleased, Toghon Temur patted both boys' shoulders. His eyes then shifted to Avraham, who never forgot his small bow. The bowstring was slung diagonally from his left shoulder to his right hip. He looked very impressive. Stepping forward, bowing respectfully with his right hand on his chest, mimicking his older brothers, he greeted with a slightly different address, "Ziyang pays respects to Huang Yeye (Imperial Grandfather)!"

Stunned, Toghon closely examined the child's face. He saw Zhang Wuji's eyebrows and eyes, then facial features that more closely resembled Ah Xiu, but when the child laughed, a blend of both was immediately apparent.

Emperor Toghon Temur's happiness today felt complete. This valiant boy was his biological grandson! He said, laughing, "That name is truly good, Ziyang — Son of Xiangyang! Are you also baptized, like all your siblings?"

Avraham nodded, then stated his baptismal name. As the name sounded unfamiliar, Toghon Temur turned to Ah Luo, who immediately explained, "That's the name given by Father Ephrem who baptized him. Its meaning is 'Father of all nations'."

"Remarkable!" Toghon Temur exclaimed.

Zhou Zhiruo was too hesitant to speak, fearing she might make a misstep. Zhao Min represented her to introduce her own beloved daughter. "Huang Shang, this is our humble daughter."

Alessandra bowed respectfully, stating her own name, "Alessandra comes to pay respects to Huang Shang."

Something in this child's demeanor and name captivated Toghon Temur. He saw Zhao Min's grace, Zhou Zhiruo's beauty, but also a very special impression, as if a shadow of Alexander the Great was living before him. The first time he met Zhao Min, she was roughly this child's age, with the same demeanor and self-confidence. He reserved his comments for a private conversation he already envisioned with Alessandra. To Zhang Wuji, he said, "Wuji, you have good children, they rekindle my hope in these bleak times!"

Zhang Wuji bowed and said, "Huang Shang overstates. These children were raised far away. They are truly not worthy of coming to pay respects to Huang Shang."

"That's nonsense," Toghon Temur said with a laugh. "We can now discuss the plan I've been waiting for a very long time..." he suddenly became gloomy, "Unfortunately, your Aunt Qi yourselves now..." then sighed and continued, forcing new enthusiasm, "Never mind, we'll talk about her later. So, are you ready to take all of this over?"

Dadu, December 1366: The Plan Takes Shape
At this moment, Zhang Wuji wore a rather peculiar attire, following Tajkis's advice. It had taken them some time to make it. At first glance, it somewhat resembled the robes of Eastern Church priests, but Tajkis said it was quite similar to the Persian Ming Cult imams she had seen. Toghon Temur had been wondering about it, but hadn't asked further. Now, he saw Zhang Wuji looking at Ah Luo, then clearing his throat, not immediately answering his question.

It was Ah Luo who spoke cautiously, "Huang Shang (Emperor), at this moment we cannot simply leave this place. Actually, we've already prepared Shangdu, as per the original plan. But if we leave directly, then Wuji will immediately face difficulties from all sides. There will be no explanation, no signs of handover, and absolutely no war or agreement whatsoever. Won't everyone come looking for Huang Shang again? And Wuji will look like someone who simply seized the throne, and immediately all factions, from both north and south, will attack Dadu! How will we handle that?"

Toghon Temur fell silent. After a moment, he finally said, "You are right. But how do we resolve all this? Do you have a way?"

Now Zhang Wuji finally opened his mouth, "If Huang Shang agrees, we will do it together. First, Wuji will present himself as an unofficial advisor to Ah You. Wuji has thought about this before. The incident in Fujian has attracted much attention. Chen Youding's way of handling it was reasonable enough, but it caused a strong reaction from the southern factions. In that manner, the Yuan Dynasty looked bad and cruel. Wuji will appear as a Zhanglao (Elder) from the Ming Cult religious movement, which is neither Muslim nor Christian, nor Hongjin Qiyi or Bailian Jiao. But still part of those Fujian people, and will appear with Ah You."

"Ah, I finally understand what you mean," Toghon Temur said, then asked, "But I don't intend to deal with this southern problem. It's best we handle Dadu; let He Zhen and Chen Youding deal with it."

Ayushiridara seized the opportunity while his father was discussing this issue. "This is correct. But Fuhuang also knows they will still push this issue to the surface in every meeting. While we handle the north, let Dage (Elder Brother) speak with them."

"Oh, in that case, I agree! This suggestion is good," his father said happily. Then he returned to his own idea, "Now, after that, we can begin to bring Wang Baobao to Dadu. Let Li Siqi fight against those southern people!" He grinned widely, commenting on Zhang Wuji's appearance, "It seems your beard isn't long enough. Don't cut it again after this. It needs to look more like those Eastern Church priests. What name will you use? You certainly can't use your own name, right?"

Alessandra was imagining her father's appearance if he had a beard as long as Father Barsauma or Father Ephrem; she felt amused but did not voice her opinion. Meanwhile, she knew her father had once asked their Grandma Tajkis about the name 'Aniu' in Old Persian. She saw now her father just smiled, then replied, "Gavaka."

---

While Ayushiridara began their family meeting with his father, in her own private room, Qi Shengniang didn't respond at all when a knock sounded at her door. As had become her routine, the door then opened, but the figure who appeared was not her personal servant, Chunhua. She was immediately startled when she recognized Dongfang Yuxian's face! But the surprise lasted only a second. Next, she appeared listless again, though inwardly she wondered, "What is this child doing in the palace? Who brought her in?"

---

*Maybe it will make the narrative a little better:*

Lowering her head, she only saw another female figure enter behind Dongfang Yuxian. She then shifted her gaze to the window. Most likely it was just Munashiri who had entered, though she didn't understand how Dongfang Yuxian could have entered the palace and met Munashiri. Ah Xiu certainly wouldn't allow this kind of behavior.

Dongfang Yuxian's voice greeted, "Good afternoon, Aunt Qi! Yuxian has brought the *zongzi*[^zongzi] Aunt Qi likes best, filled with pork, just like they sell in Jiangnan."

[^zongzi]: Zongzi (粽子) are a traditional Chinese food, particularly enjoyed during the Dragon Boat Festival. They are glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves, filled with various sweet or savory ingredients, and then steamed or boiled. The exact date of the festival varies each year, but it typically falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.

The aroma of the food piqued Qi Shengniang's senses. She felt very hungry, but she felt she couldn't betray her own plan. All of this had been painstakingly worked on for months, or perhaps even over a year? Hardening her heart, she remained silent, looking out the window.

Suddenly, her ears caught a woman's voice, now, of course, somewhat changed. She hadn't heard this voice in thirty years. The woman said gruffly, "You *stinky girl*[^chou-yatou], you can fool others, do you think you can fool me?"

Instinctively, unable to control herself, Qi Shengniang turned, exclaimed, "*Shijie*!" and saw Tajkis standing before her, still as beautiful as ever, though, of course, much older, like all of them. Her dark, bluish eyes, her curly black hair, her fair, smooth skin like alabaster, her aquiline nose—everything looked the same!

[^chou-yatou]: Chou Yatou (臭丫頭), although Yatou (丫頭) itself can be translated to "Little girl", but the entire terminology can also means "stinky brat".

[^shijie]: Shijie (師姐), 'Senior Martial Sister'.
[^xiaomei]: Xiaomei (小妹), 'Little sister'.

Realizing her act had been exposed so easily by Tajkis, she then sighed, laughed dryly, and said, "Give me that zongzi!" Looking at Tajkis, she said while waiting for Dongfang Yuxian to prepare the dumplings, "*Xiaomei*[^xiaomei] would never dare to deceive Shijie!" She stood up, hugged Tajkis tightly, and kissed her cheek. For a moment, both were lost in fond memories of the past.

"Shengniang, you've made everyone anxious," Tajkis said. "What do you want?"

"How did Shijie know all this?" Qi Shengniang asked, pouring out all the questions that instantly flooded her mind. "Besides, how did Shijie suddenly reappear in Zhongyuan? Ah Li suddenly left the palace; where is she now?"

"Ah Li took her child to Ningxia," Tajkis replied. "But Wuji told her to go to Shangdu immediately. Everything is settled there. *Er Shige*[^er-shige], Wei Yixiao, and Ding Minjun are taking care of everything. You can rest easy now. You haven't answered my question."

[^er-shige]: Er Shige (二師哥), "Second Senior Martial Brother", in this case refer to Fan Yao.

Qi Shengniang sighed, accepted the peeled zongzi from Dongfang Yuxian, took a bite, and praised the taste of the food, "Hmm... it has mushrooms, salted egg... this seems like Zhiruo's cooking; is she here?"

"Everyone's here, except Khatun and Xiao Furen," Dongfang Yuxian said. "Xiao Furen just gave birth again, and Khatun is pregnant now. Haven't you met Rut yet, Aunt Qi? Huang Shang (Emperor) adores her!"

"Oh, Ah Xiu's child with many nicknames, right?" Qi Shengniang said, smiling. She quickly finished the food, then said, "Get me another one." Answering Tajkis, she said, "Li Siqi messed up my plan. That foolish child, and Wang Baobao, should have ignored him and gone straight to Dadu; then everything would have been settled! Damn it! Now I have to use another way to force Huang Shang to leave here."

Laughing lightly, Tajkis said, "I suspected as much, so now what do you want? Everyone is here, I don't think this is too bad. Seeing Rut, Huang Shang immediately took to her, silencing everyone."

"Silencing what?" Qi Shengniang said. "That's only temporary; they have to ask, it's natural. In my opinion, let them all fight among themselves, we'll leave here! They dared to accuse me of forcing Huang Shang to retreat, so now I will truly carry it out! What do they want? I'm curious." Then she remembered something and looked sad. "All of this eventually caused Bayan to die... my fault..." She shook her head, continuing sadly, "Now Ah Li must misunderstand. That time I said something... I actually wanted to say that they should put more dignified clothes on Bayan. After thinking about it, my words must have sounded like I was insulting Bayan in Ah Li's ears..."

"Never mind, you can talk to Ah Li later," Tajkis said. "I also hurt her that time. Now, more importantly, what's your next plan?"

"For now, don't tell anyone what you see here," Qi Shengniang said, her eyes gleaming, calmly eating the *zongzi* given by Dongfang Yuxian. "Hmmm... Zhiruo's cooking is all delicious..."

---

News about developments in the south always reached them from Kaifeng, sent via Xiao Liang's pigeon network, entrusted to his daughter, Chunhua, Qi Shengniang's personal servant. Chunhua then delivered the messages to Ah Luo. Chunhua herself was unaware of Qi Shengniang's true condition.

Murong Bing reported that Zhu Yuanzhang's forces were currently besieging Suzhou, Zhang Shicheng's capital. She also stated that she didn't have the opportunity to travel too far from Suzhou, as Xu Da had been appointed chief commander for this mission.

"This letter was entrusted to Wu Zhanglao," Dongfang Yuxian said. "It seems Murong Bing can't offer much help regarding Han Lin'er's problem. Yingtian is very close to Chuzhou, but quite far from Suzhou. Murong Bing did plan to ask Yin Daxia to keep an eye on Chuzhou, but she didn't mention any progress."

"That makes sense, because *Jiujiu* must be overseeing Suzhou, so Murong Bing could ask Wu Zhanglao to send her letter to *Jiujiu*," Zhao Min said.

Zhou Zhiruo's brow furrowed. "Are you sure *Jiujiu* will help?"

"It's not very convincing, but it's better than no effort at all, right?" Zhao Min replied.

This Christmas Eve was unusually simple for Zhang Wuji's children, yet deeply special for the emperor. Because Emperor Toghon Temur was a follower of Tibetan Karma Kagyu Buddhism, Christmas celebrations in the palace weren't customary. Nevertheless, they managed a small, quiet celebration in the harem this time, thanks to Zhou Zhiruo's presence. She gathered her children in their allotted room, leading them in prayer for peace and the safety of everyone present.

Few attended this small event. However, to everyone's surprise, Emperor Toghon Temur was present, holding Rut on his lap and kneeling beside the fir tree Zhou Zhiruo had cut to symbolize the celebration. Avraham knelt to his right. Eunuch He and Eunuch Kim also attended with Toghon Temur.

The faint aroma of the fir tree piqued their senses. Candles were lit by everyone present, following Zhou Zhiruo and her children. The candlelight warmed the room in the winter cold. Rut's giggling sounded like beautiful music, adorning the simplicity of their Christmas Eve, as if the baby Jesus himself were present in Zhou Zhiruo's small family. "*Niang* (Mama), *Hai'er* (Your child) also wants to light a candle," Rut said.

Toghon took two small candles offered by Eunuch He. "Here, you can light it yourself. *Huang Yeye*[^huang-yeye] is also entrusting one to you."

[^huang-yeye]: Huang Yeye (皇爺爺), "Imperial Grandfather".

Due to the unexpected presence of Toghon and his two eunuchs, other concubines also attended, filling the not-so-large room. They all knew that Kublai Khan's birth mother, Sorghaghtani Beki, had been a devout Christian of the Eastern Church. In Toghon Temur's eyes at that moment, Zhou Zhiruo appeared much like his esteemed ancestor, Sorghaghtani Beki. Unbeknownst to him, he was inadvertently fulfilling the long-held hope of Zhao Min's birth mother, Lady Li, who currently resided in Ganzhou with Zhang Wuji's two other sons.

They all devoutly followed the small ceremony, bowing their heads in unison with Zhou Zhiruo's prayer: "For all people... O God, may we enjoy peace and tranquility, just as You brought forth Jesus in Nazareth at that time. For He is our mediator, now and forevermore..."

Alessandra and her siblings responded to their mother's prayer, "Grant our prayer, O God."


## *Ganzhou, December 24, 1366: A Peaceful Christmas Eve*

Lady Li gathered her two grandsons, along with Sikong Jiumei and Lu Xian, on the back patio overlooking the vast mountains, after celebrating Christmas Eve at church. Sikong Jiumei had celebrated at the Eastern Church with Father Barsauma's family. Lady Li wanted to gather all her family members there.

Despite the heavy snow and cold weather, her resolve remained firm. She had been reflecting on everything that had happened since Zhang Wuji took all their other children into the palace. Contrary to Sikong Jiumei and Lu Xian's expectations, Lady Li seemed calm tonight, with not a hint of tension on her face. For months, the two of them had witnessed Lady Li's busy efforts writing letters to Wudang, Xiangyang, and Ningxia. During that period, it was the first time they had seen Lady Li in such a tense state. Yet tonight, all of that had vanished. This naturally beautiful and serene middle-aged woman had regained her composure, as if her worries had vanished with the wind. They were eager to know what had happened.

Before celebrating Christmas at the Latin Church with her two grandsons and Lu Xian, Lady Li had taken them all on a pilgrimage to the Eastern Church, where Kublai Khan's mother, Sorghaghtani Beki, was always honored with a Mass. Sikong Jiumei and Lu Xian had often spoken with Lady Li about Kublai Khan's mother. They knew that in the palace, it would be almost impossible to expect their small family to celebrate Christmas. Since the birth of Zhang Wuji's children, they had never missed a Christmas or Easter celebration, no matter how difficult their circumstances. Now, Sikong Jiumei and Lu Xian wondered inwardly if the other children were currently celebrating Christmas.

Agostin voiced their collective question, remembering his twin brother, he murmured, "Perhaps right now Niang (Mama) and Alessandra are celebrating Christmas in the palace..."

His grandmother turned to him, her eyes shining. "Do you think so? Huang Shang himself is a follower of Karma Kagyu Buddhism; it's almost certain they aren't celebrating Christmas."

Something in Lady Li's tone and demeanor made Sikong Jiumei ask, "But Laolao (Grandma) feels they are celebrating?"

Gazing at the distant, dark mountains in the background of their home, Lady Li seemed to be speaking poetically, "God works in ways completely unimagined by us." She looked at Lorenzo, asking in a somewhat mysterious tone, "Rut is there, Avraham — " then looked at Lu Xian, "and Francesco."

This time, Lu Xian vaguely grasped what was meant. "Rut and Avraham are clearly Huang Shang's own grandchildren, but Francesco..."

"At that time, al-Kamil, the Sultan of Egypt, was fiercely attacked by Christian armies in the Crusades," Lady Li explained contemplatively. "That war was truly a bloodbath, and futile for the Crusaders. Finally, they agreed to a ceasefire. It was during this time that Francis of Assisi and his companions crossed into the Muslim camp, and were brought before the Sultan, staying in his tent for days. You might find it strange, but at that time Francis even preached among those Muslims..."

All the young people before her held their breath. Unable to contain his curiosity, Lorenzo asked, "Then what happened?"

"There are only reports that the Sultan received Francis warmly," Lady Li replied. "They returned unharmed."

As if uniting their hopes with Lady Li's, the two girls and her grandsons immediately made the sign of the cross, knelt devoutly, bowing their heads in silent prayer. Only a single line they eventually uttered together with Lady Li, "Grant our prayer, O God..."


## *Dadu, December 25, 1366: Politics in the Dead of Night*

Zhang Wuji and Ayushiridara couldn't join everyone in the imperial harem for Christmas. They spent the time leading up to midnight riding aimlessly, circling the city, passing entertainment venues and wine shops, and even peering into brothels.

A clear memory lingered in Zhang Wuji's mind: last year, on the same Christmas Eve, he had spent time touring Yinchuan and its outskirts in Yinnan, then met Zhao Min in a surprising encounter. Their romantic conversation that night ended with memories of Chaghan Temur, a paternal figure unforgettable to both of them, as if he lived among the people of Ningxia, in churches, mosques, and among all other citizens.

Not feeling like he'd found his father-in-law's spirit amidst the hustle and bustle of Dadu, he invited Ayushiridara to sit at a shop selling Dadu roast duck, chatting casually while drinking wine and enjoying the meal.

Suddenly, Ayushiridara's gaze fixed on a large man who had also stopped by the shop, alone. The plate in front of the man was empty. He was simply enjoying his wine while watching the commotion around him.

"Naghachu," Ayushiridara whispered, nodding towards the man's table. "Zhu Yuanzhang once captured him, but then released him. No idea what he's doing here."

"Oh," Zhang Wuji said, growing interested. He felt something intriguing was about to happen.

Shortly after, Ayushiridara recognized another man, of average build, seemingly a southerner. This man also seemed to recognize him. Walking towards them, a smile spread across his face as he politely greeted, despite knowing Ayushiridara didn't want to be widely recognized, "Taizi (Crown Prince)!"

"He Daren (Sir He)," Ayushiridara said, "Allow me to introduce my good friend — um..."

"Gavaka," Zhang Wuji said curtly, trying his best to imitate the Fujian accent. Inwardly, he thought, "My name is already clearly foreign. A slight slip will surely be excused." From Ayushiridara's words, he knew this person was He Zhen, recently appointed Governor of Guangzhou.

"Ah, Gavaka *Jiaoshi*," He Zhen said cheerfully, his eyes scrutinizing the beard on Zhang Wuji's face with a hint of suspicion. Nevertheless, after clearing his throat, he immediately asked with curiosity, "Jiaoshi perhaps hails from *Quanzhou*...?"

"*Amituofo*," Zhang Wuji said, imitating Shuobude. Then, mimicking his children and Zhou Zhiruo making the sign of the cross, he added, "*Alhamdulillah*, it seems He Daren also...?"

"Oh, no — I'm from Guangzhou," He Zhen said, laughing delightedly, feeling his guess was correct.

Unable to suppress a smile, Ayushiridara covered it by taking a drink of his wine. Accidentally, his eyes glanced towards Naghachu's table, and he found the man looking in their direction.

Ordering another portion of roast duck, they spent time well past midnight joking and chatting about politics with He Zhen. Zhang Wuji eventually concluded that, in some way, this man was still related to He Shuo and his son He Zhang, who had previously been sent by Toghon Temur to kill Bolad Temur.

When He Zhen brought up Fujian and Chen Youding's supposed success in quelling the Persian rebellion in Quanzhou, Zhang Wuji made the sign of the cross and said, "*Astaghfirullah al-Azim*! (I seek forgiveness from God, the Almighty!) Sin... sin... but it also contains *the Will of Allah*, so Laona (this old monk/daoist) has no answer..."

He Zhen became very curious, asking suspiciously, "Jiaoshi (teacher/preacher), soon I myself will be assigned by Huang Shang to support Chen Youding. You... you all... won't oppose Huang Shang's policy, will you?"

As Zhang Wuji adjusted his tall black hat, Ayushiridara suppressed a smile, silently waiting for the answer he would deliver. Clearing his throat while stroking his slowly growing beard, Zhang Wuji said, "He Daren, Laona only wants to show you this..." he took off his oversized shoe, "If Daren wears Laona's shoe, wouldn't Daren look ridiculous before the Grand Assembly? Similarly, if Laona wears Daren's small shoe." He concluded his speech by clasping his hands together, mimicking Shuobude's posture, "Therefore, it's best we wear our own shoes."

"Oh, I see...?" He Zhen mumbled, lost in thought as Zhang Wuji and Ayushiridara bid farewell, leaving money to pay for all their food and drinks. Watching Zhang Wuji's back and his tall black hat, he wondered inwardly, "This Quanzhou man doesn't seem to hold a grudge against Chen Youding, but who knows...? It seems Ayushiridara has found a new advisor... Does he now want to seize his father's throne?"
