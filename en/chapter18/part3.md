# Chapter 18

## *Dadu, January 1, 1367: Saving an Enemy?*

Emperor Toghon Temur looked bored on his throne. He had planned to take Alessandra and her siblings on a palace tour all day, then watch their riding and archery skills. After that, he wanted to showcase their martial arts prowess before the imperial guards, whom he currently considered lazy. But the voices of the people before him continued, discussing the same issues day after day, without any clear solutions.

Annoyed, he tapped the table before him with a metal plate, cutting short what he considered to be He Zhen's protracted speech. "He Zhen, I told you, handle your own region, don't meddle in other matters!"

Inwardly, He Zhen grew suspicious. This sentence seemed similar to Gavaka's earlier remark about 'shoes,' but he dared not refute it. As a last effort, he merely said, "Your humble servant only wished to remind Bixia (Your Majesty), Fujian and Guangzhou could actually cooperate to suppress Fang Guozhen..."

"Fang Guozhen has been fine all this time," Toghon Temur interjected. "That man only likes money. As long as his share is settled, he won't meddle in other regions' affairs, unless we ask him to. There's no need to tamper with him now!"

Glancing briefly at Zhang Wuji, who sat to Ayushiridara's left, He Zhen no longer dared to speak. He returned to his seat after bowing respectfully.

"Anyone else?" Toghon Temur asked, suppressing a yawn, taking a few sips from his wine goblet.

Naghachu rose, bowed respectfully, and said, "Bixia, there is actually one thing we can do to further hinder those southerners."

"Oh?" Somewhat interested, Toghon postponed drinking from his goblet, saying, "Speak!"

"Instead of keeping an eye on Fang Guozhen, Daren Chen and Daren He could cooperate to secure Han Lin'er," Naghachu said calmly.

He Zhen's eyebrows shot up at this proposal. He said rather loudly, "Naghachu, do you mean we should cooperate to escort an enemy?" he sneered. "Have you taken your medicine this morning?"

But Toghon Temur sensed something very interesting behind that statement. He raised his hand and said, "Continue your explanation. What do you mean by securing Han Lin'er?"

From the corner of his eye, Naghachu now saw Ayushiridara listening to Zhang Wuji's whisper, and nodding faintly with a subtle smile. He felt deeply satisfied, saying calmly, "Bixia, in the south right now, we can easily see that the Yingtian faction has surrounded Suzhou. If at the same time, after feeling certain of victory, they send Han Lin'er to the afterlife, then the winner of that 'match' will next attract even more supporters, all of whom will surely turn their sights toward Dadu!" he cleared his throat, mumbling indistinctly, "perhaps... certain people will also join them..."

Hearing Naghachu's last sentence, delivered as if in a daydream, most people began to laugh at He Zhen, feeling the remark was indirectly aimed at him.

He Zhen, however, was greatly offended, forgetting he was in a courtroom, and retorted sharply, "You'd better explain what you mean by 'certain people'!"

Toghon Temur immediately understood Naghachu's meaning, finding the idea very brilliant. He turned to Ayushiridara and asked, "What do you think?"

"Oh," said Toghon Temur, smiling. "You must explain it so others understand too."

Ayushiridara stood, facing the assembly, and said with full conviction, "Currently, a million arrows are aimed at Han Lin'er, but once he dies, these arrows will become one. At that point, they will be unbreakable."

Amidst the growing hum of whispers around them, Zhang Wuji offered a faint smile towards Ayushiridara. This didn't escape the notice of both Naghachu and He Zhen, who received differing reactions from Toghon Temur.

He Zhen was forbidden from leaving his own territory, while Naghachu was tasked with secretly saving Han Lin'er.

Exiting the assembly hall, Toghon Temur and Eunuch He walked towards the archery practice grounds. There, he saw Alessandra and her siblings training. He asked the eunuch beside him, "Have you ever loved your enemy?"

Startled, Eunuch He merely shook his head, saying earnestly, "Your foolish servant does not understand what Bixia means."

Toghon Temur laughed, walking towards Alessandra, who was gathering her siblings to begin sword formation practice. He said with joyful laughter, "Hey, someone's birthday is today, don't you remember?"

Smiling widely, Avraham turned to his other siblings, answering for them, "Huang Yeye (Imperial Grandfather), today is the birthday of our Elder Sister and Elder Brother in Ganzhou!"

Rut, who was also present, escorted by Dongfang Yuxian, clapped her hands joyfully. "Jiejie's birthday!"

Toghon Temur drew a golden knife from his belt and called Alessandra closer. "Today I appoint you the official guardian of all children in this palace! Receive this as a token of command!"

Alessandra and her siblings were greatly surprised, but they all happily knelt as Alessandra received the honor with both hands. Expressing thanks, Alessandra asked, "Huang Shang, what task must Hai'er (Your humble servant) perform?"

Earnestly, Toghon Temur said, "In a few days, you must escort your siblings and all other children in this palace to Shangdu. Only Eunuch Kim will go with you there." He looked seriously into Alessandra's eyes as he asked, "Are you afraid?"

Alessandra shook her head. "Not at all. Hai'er will carry out this task, staking her life on it!"

"Good!" Toghon Temur said happily. He then turned to Avraham, "A few days ago, your mother read a sentence from Jesus, about 'loving your enemy,' do you still remember it?"

Avraham always remembered what Zhou Zhiruo read to him by heart. He recited fluently, "Jesus said: You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy', but I say to you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you'.[^matius-5]" He then turned to Alessandra, asking, "Jiejie, what does that mean?"

[^matius-5]: This quote is from Matthew 5: 43-44.

Alessandra's brow furrowed; she could only shake her head. "Jiejie doesn't know either."

Matteo, who had heard their mother say that the sentence was read from the writings of an author who shared his name, asked for the continuation of the sentence with full interest. He ended up listening to the reading written by Zhou Zhiruo based on what Father Barsauma and Father Ephrem had told her. He also did not understand its deepest meaning but could memorize it well: "That's because, if we only love those who love us, then what's the difference from tax collectors? They are the same. Jesus said, what's so great about greeting our own brothers, don't even unbelievers do that?"

"Oh!" said Toghon Temur. "So that's it..."

Driven by curiosity, Avraham asked, "Huang Yeye, what does it mean?"

Toghon Temur shook his head full of regret, mumbling indistinctly, "What a pity... even if it's not too late, he won't have a chance..."

## *Yangtze River, January 1367: Saving His Majesty, Killing Him*

About two weeks after Alessandra received her assignment, Naghachu's ship arrived on the Yangtze River, where Han Lin'er was sailing with a large number of his guards. Han Lin'er's ship wasn't very big, not a warship. In the middle of the river, far from the banks, several other ships approached and charged towards them. No sound of cannon fire, no flames. However, during the assault, a large number of divers punctured the bottom of Han Lin'er's ship, slowly but surely, the ship began to sink.

When Naghachu's envoy arrived at the same spot and jumped onto the sinking vessel, they saw a tall, large middle-aged man standing on the doomed deck. His figure was imposing, his stance firm. He stood unmoving in the strong wind, gazing into the distance.

"Hey, what are you doing there?" shouted the Captain of Naghachu's envoy ship.

The man sadly shook his head. He merely pointed to a spot on the water's surface. "You're too late, look..."

A yellow robe floated on the river. The body of the person wearing it lay face down, half-submerged, unmoving. "Is that... that... him...?"

"Who else?" the man said curtly. The next second, he turned, then swiftly leaped into the water on the other side of the sinking ship. The Captain of Naghachu's envoy ship gave chase in the same direction. But they only saw the middle-aged man in a small rowboat, sailing west while waving his hand.

About an hour later, the man disembarked on the opposite bank. His horse was waiting not far from the river's edge. Not far from the horse, a twenty-seven-year-old youth was waiting for him, smiling as he asked, "It seems it's done. Yin Daxia, where do we go now?"

Grinning broadly, Yin Yewang said, "Kunlun Mountain. Don't be afraid â€” *you're dead now*!"
