# Paladin in the Violent Winds

This story reimagines Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) Yitian Tulong Ji, also known as The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Slaying Sabre, by exploring an underexplored event within his original narrative.

The original Chinese title, Yitian Tulong Ji (倚天屠龍記), carries a profound symbolism: 'Yitian' (Heaven's Will) and 'Tulong' (Slaying the Dragon). Combined, they mean 'Slaying the Dragon by Following Heaven's Will'. In ancient Chinese culture, the 'Dragon' is a direct metaphor for the Emperor or the Imperial Throne. Our tale expands on this prophetic title.


## Unraveling the Original Narrative

Our reimagined story begins by dissecting specific details from Chapter 34 of Jin Yong's original work. [You can find a fan-made English translation here](https://foxswuxia.wordpress.com/condor-trilogy-heaven-sword-dragon-saber/yttlj-chapter-34/).

If you print that chapter to PDF, on page 56, you'll find the first face-to-face encounter between Zhang Wuji (Hokkien: Thio Buki) and Zhao Min's (Hokkien: Tio Beng) biological father, General Chaghan Temur. This meeting happens after Zhang Wuji was gravely injured fighting Tibetan monks, shortly after Zhao Min disrupted Zhang Wuji's wedding to Zhou Zhiruo (Hokkien: Chou Cijiak), marking the start of their grand adventures together.

However, certain aspects of Jin Yong's narrative in this section always felt a bit... unusual:

1. *Chaghan Temur's Unacknowledged Title*: Chaghan Temur was never explicitly referred to as a 'Wangye' (Prince or King) of the Yuan Dynasty in the original story, despite being a truly loyal and militarily powerful defender of the dynasty. He eventually became the strongest general before his assassination en route to Yidu.

2. *The Age Discrepancy*: Chaghan Temur died at the young age of 34, born in 1328 CE and passing on July 6, 1362, during his journey to Yidu. This raises a critical question: How could a Zhao Min, depicted as being in her twenties, have accompanied Zhang Wuji before her father's death? This timeline simply doesn't add up.

3. *A Plausible Timeline for Zhao Min*: To make the narrative historically consistent, I've set Zhao Min's birthdate to September 15, 1342 CE. This means she was born when Chaghan himself was 14. To maintain historical accuracy and family dynamics, I've introduced Lady Li, a woman from the Naiman tribe (a historical association with Chaghan), as Chaghan's first wife. Lady Li is 6 years older than Chaghan (a common age difference among Yuan Dynasty officials at the time). With these adjustments, Zhao Min would be twenty years old at the time of Chaghan's death. This also means she would have been a spirited young girl, no more than 12, when she famously crashed Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo's wedding. This aligns perfectly with Jin Yong's own explicit portrayal of Zhang Wuji dismissing Zhao Min's initial interest as mere "puppy love from a little girl," which he expected to fade away with time.

4. *Wang Baobao's Identity and Religious Context*: The character Wang Baobao was indeed originally known by his Han Chinese name, Wang Baobao, a descendant of the Wang family. [He only received a Mongolian bestowed name from Emperor Toghon Temur after successfully delivering supplies to Dadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Turban_Rebellions#K%C3%B6ke_Tem%C3%BCr). Jin Yong often treated the adoption of Han names by Mongols as a trivial joke. However, our story takes a completely different approach. Chaghan Temur himself hailed from the Naiman tribe, which was historically a conquered tribe of Genghis Khan. Historical records suggest the Naiman tribe may have practiced Christianity or even Manichaeism (Ming Jiao or Beng Kauw). Jin Yong, however, rather simplistically portrays Chaghan as foolishly opposing Manichaeism. Our narrative will flip this dynamic. Read more about the historical context of the Red Turban Rebellions and Köke Temür (Chaghan Temur's Mongolian name) here.

5. *Lady Li, A Name of Propriety*: The designation of Lady Li (Li Furen) for Zhao Min's birth mother becomes official and appropriate in our story. This is because Chaghan himself often used the Han name, Li Cha Han. For a woman of that era, whose official name was often unrecorded or who was primarily known by familiar appellations, 'Li Furen' or 'Madam Li' serves as a very reasonable and historically fitting name for Zhao Min's mother.

6. *Chaghan Temur's Role as a Father*: In that first meeting, after realizing his own daughter—then no more than twelve years old—had fallen in love with Zhang Wuji, Chaghan Temur would naturally have offered much deeper guidance and interaction than the somewhat cartoonish version written by Jin Yong (which could, in retrospect, trigger serious racial fanaticism). Our story explores a more believable and profound paternal response, considering the gravity of the situation.
