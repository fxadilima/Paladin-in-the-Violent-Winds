# Paladin in the Violent Winds

This story reimagines Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) Yitian Tulong Ji, also known as The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Slaying Sabre, by exploring an underexplored event within his original narrative.

The original Chinese title, Yitian Tulong Ji (倚天屠龍記), carries a profound symbolism: 'Yitian' (Heaven's Will) and 'Tulong' (Slaying the Dragon). Combined, they mean 'Slaying the Dragon by Following Heaven's Will'. In ancient Chinese culture, the 'Dragon' is a direct metaphor for the Emperor or the Imperial Throne. Our tale expands on this prophetic title.

It's worth noting that the popular Indonesian and English titles ("The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Slaying Sabre" and "Kisah Pedang Langit dan Golok Pembunuh Naga") actually derive from folk tales circulating within Jin Yong's story itself, which eventually became associated with the two mythical weapons, 'Yitian Jian' (Heavenly Sword) and 'Tulong Dao' (Dragon S Slaying Sabre). Interestingly, the characters for 'Sword' (劍 - Jian) and 'Sabre' (刀 - Dao) aren't explicitly in the original title, reflecting their origin in these evolving legends. This very verse is frequently quoted by Zhang Wuji throughout the narrative.

## Unraveling the Original Narrative

Our reimagined story begins by dissecting specific details from Chapter 34 of Jin Yong's original work. [You can find a fan-made English translation here](https://foxswuxia.wordpress.com/condor-trilogy-heaven-sword-dragon-saber/yttlj-chapter-34/).

If you print that chapter to PDF, on page 56, you'll find the first face-to-face encounter between Zhang Wuji (Hokkien: Thio Buki) and Zhao Min's (Hokkien: Tio Beng) biological father, General Chaghan Temur. This meeting happens after Zhang Wuji was gravely injured fighting Tibetan monks, shortly after Zhao Min disrupted Zhang Wuji's wedding to Zhou Zhiruo (Hokkien: Chou Cijiak), marking the start of their grand adventures together.

However, certain aspects of Jin Yong's narrative in this section always felt a bit... unusual:

1. *Chaghan Temur's Unacknowledged Title*: Chaghan Temur was never explicitly referred to as a 'Wangye' (Prince or King) of the Yuan Dynasty in the original story, despite being a truly loyal and militarily powerful defender of the dynasty. He eventually became the strongest general before his assassination en route to Yidu.

2. *The Age Discrepancy*: Chaghan Temur died at the young age of 34, born in 1328 CE and passing on July 6, 1362, during his journey to Yidu. This raises a critical question: How could a Zhao Min, depicted as being in her twenties, have accompanied Zhang Wuji before her father's death? This timeline simply doesn't add up.

3. *A Plausible Timeline for Zhao Min*: To make the narrative historically consistent, I've set Zhao Min's birthdate to September 15, 1342 CE. This means she was born when Chaghan himself was 14. To maintain historical accuracy and family dynamics, I've introduced Lady Li, a woman from the Naiman tribe (a historical association with Chaghan), as Chaghan's first wife. Lady Li is 6 years older than Chaghan (a common age difference among Yuan Dynasty officials at the time). With these adjustments, Zhao Min would be twenty years old at the time of Chaghan's death. This also means she would have been a spirited young girl, no more than 12, when she famously crashed Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo's wedding. This aligns perfectly with Jin Yong's own explicit portrayal of Zhang Wuji dismissing Zhao Min's initial interest as mere "puppy love from a little girl," which he expected to fade away with time.

4. *Wang Baobao's Identity and Religious Context*: The character Wang Baobao was indeed originally known by his Han Chinese name, Wang Baobao, a descendant of the Wang family. [He only received a Mongolian bestowed name from Emperor Toghon Temur after successfully delivering supplies to Dadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Turban_Rebellions#K%C3%B6ke_Tem%C3%BCr). Jin Yong often treated the adoption of Han names by Mongols as a trivial joke. However, our story takes a completely different approach. Chaghan Temur himself hailed from the Naiman tribe, which was historically a conquered tribe of Genghis Khan. Historical records suggest the Naiman tribe may have practiced Christianity or even Manichaeism (Ming Jiao or Beng Kauw). Jin Yong, however, rather simplistically portrays Chaghan as foolishly opposing Manichaeism. Our narrative will flip this dynamic. Read more about the historical context of the Red Turban Rebellions and Köke Temür (Wang baobao's Mongolian name) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Turban_Rebellions#K%C3%B6ke_Tem%C3%BCr).

5. *Lady Li, A Name of Propriety*: The designation of Lady Li (Li Furen) for Zhao Min's birth mother becomes official and appropriate in our story. This is because Chaghan himself often used the Han name, Li Cha Han. For a woman of that era, whose official name was often unrecorded or who was primarily known by familiar appellations, 'Li Furen' or 'Madam Li' serves as a very reasonable and historically fitting name for Zhao Min's mother.

6. *Chaghan Temur's Role as a Father*: In that first meeting, after realizing his own daughter—then no more than twelve years old—had fallen in love with Zhang Wuji, Chaghan Temur would naturally have offered much deeper guidance and interaction than the somewhat cartoonish version written by Jin Yong (which could, in retrospect, trigger serious racial fanaticism). Our story explores a more believable and profound paternal response, considering the gravity of the situation.

7. *Revisiting the Imperial Portrayal*: Toghon Temur and Ayushiridara: Jin Yong's description of Emperor Toghon Temur's appearance might be justified: "*Zhang Wuji focused his attention to see the Mongolian Emperor. He noticed that the Emperor’s countenance was thin, pallid, and dispirited. In just one glance it was obvious that he indulged in wine. The Crown Prince rode a horse next to the sedan chair. Contrary to his expectations, the Crown Prince actually showed a heroic spirit. He had a gilded long bow, inlaid with jade, on his shoulder; truly fit the image of a Mongolian young hero.*" — However, the portrayal of Crown Prince Ayushiridara seems somewhat exaggerated. Ayushiridara was actually *the same age as Han Lin'er*, who was also present in Jin Yong's narrative during the same event. Both were born in 1340 CE. If you trace the timeline of events, this particular incident could not have occurred much later than 1353-1354 CE, before the death of Han Lin'er's father, Han Shantong. This means both young men would likely have been no older than 14-year-old teenagers. This realization raises several other critical questions:

    - **Zhang Wuji's Moral Compass**: Zhang Wuji, a leader of pure and compassionate spirit, always prioritizing mercy, sees a young Han Lin'er (13 or 14 years old) verbally abusing the common citizens of Dadu with hateful rhetoric as 'Traitors!' for praising the reigning emperor, and he supports this notion? This seems inconsistent with his character.
    - **One-Sided Cruelty**: The 'cruelty' of the Yuan Dynasty's imperial guards is starkly depicted, almost cartoonishly so, but Jin Yong fails to balance this with the documented brutality of the Southern Red Turban rebels against their opponents. This creates a serious bias for naive readers.
    - **The Myth of Corruption**: 'Mongolian officials' are depicted as utterly corrupt, thus justifying their replacement by a 'new dynasty.' Yet, Jin Yong completely overlooks the profound corruption of the two 'new dynasties' that subsequently emerged. Fundamentally, the leaders in the south were locked in internal conflict, vying for a still-unformed power, without even supporting each other!

8. *The Nuance of the Yuan Dynasty*: Any story about the Yuan Dynasty feels incomplete and awkward if it merely emphasizes 'how great the Han people are' versus 'how bad the Mongols are,' to the extent of reducing Empress Qi and Empress Bayan to mere 'two middle-aged fat women.' The original text states: "*The Emperor sat on the highest platform, with the two Empresses on either side of him. The Empresses were middle-age fat women, bundled inside robes inlaid with pearls, jade and precious jewels. Needless to say, they glittered with brilliant lights. On their heads, they wore ridiculously strange-looking tall crowns.*" This can be found on page 19 if you print the linked chapter to PDF as suggested. A sudden reflection arises:

    - **Empress Qi's True Character**: Empress Qi, or 'Ki' / 'Gi,' was a woman of Goryeo (Korean) descent, born in Haengju, who was historically described as *extremely beautiful*. Emperor Toghon Temur was so infatuated that he continuously sought to make her a formal 'Empress,' not just a common concubine. Jin Yong completely overlooks this fascinating detail. Conversely, our story delves deeply into this historical fact. Empress Qi was born in 1315 CE, meaning at this point in the narrative, she would not yet be 40 years old!
    - **Empress Bayan's Simplicity**: Empress Bayan was known historically as a simple woman who never even wore luxurious clothes. Yet, Jin Yong describes both empresses as "*...bundled inside robes inlaid with pearls, jade and precious jewels*"? Our story will portray the personal grandeur of Empress Bayan, merging it with the character of a woman 'discarded' by Jin Yong, ending up as nothing more than a 'crazy girl' — **Yin Li**.

9. *Manichaeism*: Beyond Simple Rebellion: Manichaeism, a central nuance of the original story, underwent various adaptations in different regions to gain local acceptance. This was not as simplistic or shallow as Jin Yong portrayed it—merely a movement to expel the barbarians. In the Yuan Dynasty era, **Peng Yingyu**, a real historical figure, initiated this rebellion. His teachings, while not explicitly containing such rebellious phrases, implicitly carried the potential to incite revolt, and it appears Peng Yingyu himself either allowed or intentionally encouraged this interpretation.

10. *The "Holy Maiden" Anomaly in Manichaeism*: A glaring inconsistency in Jin Yong's narrative is the assertion that Persian Manichaeism taught its followers to have a 'Holy Maiden' as their leader. This is particularly strange, considering Manichaeism itself originated from the spiritual experiences of a Persian named 'Mani,' who was one hundred percent male. How, then, could it evolve into a doctrine that prioritizes a woman as its leader? This specific incongruity, in our story, deeply troubles Xiao Zhao, who is clearly in love with, and loved by, Zhang Wuji!

Unlike Jin Yong's narrative, where Manichaeism has been persecuted during the late Yuan Dynasty, in here, we try to maintain historically correct nuances found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Manichaeism#Song_and_Yuan_dynasties, quoted as follow:

"Their fortunes changed during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, where the religion enjoyed a stable existence while the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism served as the ‘’de facto’’ state religion of the Yuan. Two elaborate silk paintings survive from this era: *Manichaean Diagram of the Universe and Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation*. These works provide an insight into Yuan-era cosmology of Chinese Manichaeism."
