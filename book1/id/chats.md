# Menyembelih Naga, Melakukan Kehendak Surga

Bagian ini adalah 'Buku 1' dari karya besar Jin Yong — *Yitian Tulong Ji* (倚天屠龍記), yang saya tulis ulang, dengan lebih mengandalkan akurasi dengan peristiwa sejarah, meskipun masih berusaha mempertahankan semangat nuansa aslinya.

Seperti yang dijabarkan dalam [README di bagian awal](../../README.md), penelitian saya memang bermula dari 'Jilid 34' versi bahasa Inggris hasil terjemahan *fans* tersebut, tepatnya pada titik di mana Zhang Wuji dan Zhao Min kecil berjumpa dengan Chaghan Temur — ayah kandung Zhao Min. Tetapi saya juga memasukkan elemen lain yang sama sekali tidak dibahas di dalam karya Jin Yong. Hal ini akhirnya membuat saya memutuskan untuk menulis ulang semuanya sekaligus, karena sangat sulit menyusun narasi dengan hanya menyelipkan elemen-elemen terkait dengan inti cerita.

*Prolog* dalam karya asli Jin Yong sangat panjang, dan sebagian besar menceritakan tentang pertemuan Zhang Sanfeng muda dengan Yang Guo, membuat cerita ini tersambung ke Trilogi kedua dalam cerita asli Jin Yong. Tetapi sebenarnya narasi cukup berat itu tak banyak diceritakan lagi dalam perkembangan. Saya memakai bagian *prolog* untuk menceritakan latar belangan lain, yang boleh dikatakan tidak dibahas dalam karya asli Jin Yong, yaitu tentang seorang anak perempuan kecil, dilahirkan di Haengju pada tahun 1315, yang akhirnya akan menjadi Permaisuri Qi — pribadi yang wajib diceritakan dalam kisah tentang era akhir Dinasti Yuan.

If in 1341 (counting from Zhang Wuji'a 9 years old age, as we made him born in 1332), Zhang Sanfeng was celebrating his 100 years old birthday, then we can safely assume (or invent) his birthyear is around 1241.

According to Jin Yong, when Zhang Sanfeng was around 13, he was encountered Yang Guo, Xiao Longnu and also 16 or 17 years old Guo Xiang. This means, that year *must* be 1254. But, again, Jin Yong was inaccurate (either deliberately or not). Because at the time, he also wrote Yang Guo has already kill Mongke Khan, while Mongke Khan, historically, died on 1259.

This give us several choices:

1. Using Zhang Sanfeng's birthday as the base to calculate events.
2. Using Mongke Khan's death as the base.

Or we can use both, thus, yields:

- Zhang Sanfeng should be around 20 when he met Guo Xiang.
- Since this event was a side story anyway, then we can replace it all together, to slightly implicate Guo Xiang and also her parents — as the original creators of Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao (mandatory).

*Maintaining Character Connections: If Zhang Sanfeng was 13 when he met Yang Guo and Guo Xiang, and Yang Guo had already killed Mongke Khan (1259), then Zhang Sanfeng would have to be born in 1246. This means he'd be 95 in 1341, not 100.*
- Unfortunately, this cannot be done, due to some events in Jin Yong's narrative *is also mandatory*. In Zhnag Sanfeng's 100 years celebration, these events occored:
    
    1. Tragic death of Zhang Wuji's parents, voluntarily suicide because unwilling to say Xie Xun's whereabout.
    2. All 6 major sects come to Wudang, under the pretext to celebrate Zhang Sanfeng's 100 years, albeit false. They just want to pressed Zhang Cuishan to say where his sworn brother is.
    
    This is why it cannot be adjusted.

Well, I have another idea. Since we want to rewrite the whole story anyway, and the meeting of Zhang Sanfeng and Guo Xiang is now (in the timeframe of Yitian Tulong Ji) a *legend*, then we, in order to *humanized* those legend, can have *Zhang Sanfeng himself* tell the story (which some readers would love to read) that he met Guo Xiang at his 20s! We can remove or *blur the previous meeting* exact years. Zhang Sanfeng (at the time was Zhang Junbao)'s personal story is not so clear anyway. We can have *this* Zhang Sanfeng wonder, what if he have a chance know Guo Xiang (who actually a few years his senior) a bit longer?

Meanwhile, our 5 years old (would later on be) Empress Qi was sill in Haengju, her hometown, listening her old martial arts master (about 90 years old at the time). He was originally from Zhongyuan, runaway to Goryeo after Xiangyang fall and Guo Jing died. So, this master is equally important of the historical source (albeit he is a fictional character). As he — Duoluo Haoyu — was born 1230 (actually older than Zhang Sanfeng, if still alive). Qi Shengniang (future Empress Qi), lost her dearest teacher when she was around 11. Douluo Haoyu, onece learned from Yelu Qi, after Guo Jing and Huang Rong died, and later on, after Yelu Qi also died, he becomes a formidable hero. This is why Qi Shengniang knew about 18 Dragon Subduing Palm technique, and also Yue Nu Jian Fa from Han Xiaoying.

**Ideas for Further Development:**

1. Duoluo Haoyu's Past (Subtly): While his background as an eight-pouch Beggars' Sect elder and his connection to Yelu Qi (and thus Guo Jing/Huang Rong) is explicitly stated in your notes, consider how to subtly hint at this in the narrative itself, perhaps through a brief internal thought from Haoyu, or a comment he makes. This isn't necessary immediately, but something to keep in mind for his eventual detailed backstory. For example, he might observe the officer's rough demeanor and mentally compare it to the discipline (or lack thereof) he saw in his Beggars' Sect days.

2. Ki Ja-oh's Observation: You mentioned that "Ki Ja-oh ... discovered that Duoluo Haoyu is a high-level martial arts expert." The current scene shows Haoyu's subtle intervention. Perhaps Ki Ja-oh or one of his men was among the onlookers and specifically noticed Haoyu's swift, almost invisible movement. This could be a good point to show how his abilities were discovered, rather than just stating it. For instance, the man who saw Haoyu move could be working for Ki Ja-oh.

3. Ki Son-yeo's Reaction to the Market Incident: While her attention is on her teacher, what is her five-year-old perspective of this small skirmish? Does she show fear, curiosity, or a tiny spark of admiration for her teacher's unseen intervention? This could further establish her character traits early on. Perhaps she just notices the officer stumble and looks at her teacher with innocent wonder.

4. The "Holy Maiden" Name: You've explained the meaning of "Qi Shengniang" in a footnote, but within the narrative, could there be a brief, tender moment where Duoluo Haoyu explains why he gave her that name? This would deepen their bond and foreshadow her future importance. It could be something as simple as him saying, "Because you have a pure spirit, like a little Holy Maiden," or "You have the potential to bring righteousness to the world, my little Shengniang."
