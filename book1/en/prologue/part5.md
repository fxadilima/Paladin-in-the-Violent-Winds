She heard Tajkis say, "Ah, that's right! I almost forgot. Qi Shimei, from now on you can join us. This isn't official yet; I'll tell everything to Yang Jiaozhu later. But you don't need to worry, he'll definitely accept you. I suppose you'll also be in my group next." She smiled broadly, then warmly embraced Qi Shengniang, saying, "I hope you don't mind this kind of Jianghu life. Just consider it your destiny."

Qi Shengniang clapped her hands in delight. "How could I mind?" she said. "With you all, I don't have to be afraid anymore if I meet that bastard Wang Jeong and his guards!"

Yang Xiao asked, "Qi Shimei, why do you think that little prince wanted to capture you?"

"*Da Shige*[^da-shige], if I knew, I probably wouldn't have needed to flee here," Qi Shengniang replied sadly.

[^da-shige]: Da Shige (大師哥), "Eldest Martial Brother".

Suddenly, Fan Yao burst into laughter, then said, "Don't tell me you all still don't know? It's clear that little bastard fell in love with our Qi Shimei! That's not strange at all."

This simple joke surprisingly made Qi Shengniang's face flush, incomprehensibly to herself. For the second time, she felt her chest pound, because the one who said this was Fan Yao. However, Tajkis said, "I think that's true. But don't tease her anymore; our Qi Shimei is still too young. She doesn't understand such matters yet."

"I think Qi Shimei should keep wearing male clothes," Yang Xiao said. "That way, not everyone will easily recognize her. We also need to quickly find your two unruly disciples in Jiangnan. I'm worried they've run into trouble; it's been too long since they left us."

Suddenly, from a distance, they heard a woman's cry, "No need!" Then two young girls, about two years younger than Tajkis, emerged from behind the trees, leading three horses. "We saw you all in the town square earlier, but it was a bit hard to find you here."

"Mei Jian, Ah Luo!" Tajkis exclaimed happily. "You're back! What did you find?"

Both girls had distinct southern features, with wide, beautiful eyes. But one was tall, much taller than Tajkis, while the second, who was currently leading two horses, was of average Han woman height, but her figure was very beautiful despite her young age.

The tall girl bowed respectfully to Tajkis, greeting, "Mei Jian wishes to congratulate *Ah Jie*[^ah-jie], you've just found a new junior sister!" She grinned broadly, then said to Qi Shengniang, "Qi Shimei, your name fits perfectly as the youngest member of this group! We heard your conversation earlier."[^qi]

[^ah-jie]: Ah Jie (阿姐), basically the sama as Jiejie (姐姐), "Elder Sister" or "Big Sister".
[^qi]: Qi Shengniang surname is Qi (奇), also written the same in Hanja. The Hangul (기) not yet popular or even exists at the time. But it can sound similar to Qi (七), which is number 7.

"So the tall one is Mei Jian," Qi Shengniang thought. She greeted back with a respectful attitude, "Si Shijie (Fourth Senior Sister)!"

Mei Jian laughed, saying, "Qi Shimei, you're mistaken, I'm not the fourth sister, I'm only number six, one rank above you."

Ah Luo giggled, handing the horse reins she was holding to Qi Shengniang. "And I'm the fifth," she said. "Qi Shimei, you left your horse in the town square earlier. We brought it back for you."

Qi Shengniang was puzzled, never recalling owning a horse. "But I don't have a horse."

"Well, now you do," Ah Luo replied, her tone somewhat mysterious.

"How did you two know you'd be in positions five and six?" Tajkis said, laughing. "If we find someone younger than Qi Shimei next, that title itself will change."

"Ah Jie, that won't be necessary," Ah Luo said. Both of them were accustomed to calling Tajkis 'Ah Jie,' which was essentially the same as 'Jiejie,' or older sister. "Because we brought back the fourth sister."

She clapped her hands three times as a signal, and another girl, about the same age as Tajkis, appeared from behind the trees, leading her horse and smiling broadly.

"Susu!" Tajkis exclaimed in delight. "So you managed to bring her here!"

The girl warmly embraced Tajkis, then greeted Yang Xiao and Fan Yao, "Yin Susu greets *Da Shige*[^da-shige] and *Er Shige*[^er-shige]!" Then she looked at Qi Shengniang and said, "Qi Shimei, it's so good to meet you. So it was you who saved me from possibly being kidnapped by that prince."

[^er-shige]: Er Shiger (二師哥), "Second Martial Brother".
[^shijie]: Shijie (師姐), "Senior Martial Sister", as opposed to Shimei (師妹), which means "Junior Martial Sister". Just add the consecutive numbers respectively "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven", "yi er san si wu liu qi" (一二三四五六七) and we get, for example San Shijie (三師姐) for Tajkis, and Qi Shimei (七師妹) for Qi Shengniang.

[^shimei]: Shimei (師妹), "Junior Martial Sister".


Qi Shengniang could now see more clearly: this Yin Susu (殷素素) had a small, delicate face, snow-white skin, and wide, beautiful eyes typical of southern women, with long, curled eyelashes. Her crystal-clear irises seemed to tell stories just by looking at them. When she was happy, as she was at that moment, her beautiful eyes conveyed joy beyond the words she uttered. She spoke with a captivating intonation, akin to someone reading poetry. Her voice was not too high-pitched, so melodious and pleasant to the ear. Whether intentional or not, her choice of words tended to be poetic, feeling perfectly aligned with her appearance. Qi Shengniang couldn't find the right words to adequately describe Yin Susu.

If Tajkis weren't also there, in Qi Shengniang's eyes, this girl would be the most beautiful woman present. In contrast to the always-serious Tajkis, Yin Susu was like a cheerful little forest fairy. Just by looking at her, a sad person would feel comforted.

"Shengniang greets Fourth Sister," Qi Shengniang said, bowing respectfully. Suddenly, Tajkis rebuked her, "Qi Shimei (七師妹), from now on, never mention your full name in front of others. As we agreed earlier, even in front of others, we will only address each other as fellow martial siblings. You must get used to this as quickly as possible."

"This junior sister truly forgot," Qi Shengniang said, quickly. "This junior sister apologizes." Yin Susu laughed, embracing her and saying to Tajkis, "Shijie (師姐), don't be too harsh. She's still a child."

"*Da Xiaojie*[^da-xiaojie] suddenly becomes a Shimei," Yang Xiao remarked. "Have you asked your father for permission?"

[^da-xiaojie]: Da Xiaojie (大小姐). This term can be translated into something like "Young Lady of the house", refering to the most respected daughter of the master.

Tajkis snorted. "I think you are the one who objects to calling her 'Shimei'," she said. "Doesn't that demote your rank?"

"Tajkis — err, I mean San Shimei — it's quite difficult in this matter," Fan Yao said. "Imagine, if I suddenly called her 'Shimei', wouldn't that make her the junior martial sister of her own father?" He laughed, continuing, "Her father might even think I intend to propose to her."

Yin Susu blushed. At that time, she was nearly sixteen, and she could see that Fan Yao was very handsome. But she had always considered him a senior, though not on the same level as her own father, Yin Tianzheng. She knew that their leader had recently appointed Yang Xiao and Fan Yao as the Left and Right Emissaries, which put them on par with her father, or even higher. But in this situation, Fan Yao spoke very casually and freely, completely disregarding seniority or rank. This made everyone feel that what he had just suggested was very plausibly a real intention. Although she knew Fan Yao wasn't truly proposing, everyone burst into laughter.

Conversely, something stirred within Qi Shengniang's heart. For some reason, at this moment, she felt as if Yin Susu was her rival. She couldn't deny this feeling, nor could she explain its cause. Fortunately, this feeling didn't last long. As soon as this kind of conversation ended, she returned to feeling the previous warmth when speaking with Yin Susu.

Suddenly, Tajkis laughed and said, "If you're serious, I myself will speak to Yin *Qianbei* for you. But for now, you must first prove that you are worthy of it."

Yin Susu blushed even more, her face turning red as she said, "Shijie, he's just joking..."

Tajkis winked at her, then turned to Fan Yao and continued, "It's time the pirates in Jiangnan were taught a lesson. It's time for us to act. If your guts are too small to do it, then let the five of us go alone; you two wait here. Don't be afraid, I'll tell Yin Qianbei later that you also contributed to this."

Fan Yao felt his blood boil. He said, "Who says I'm scared?" He rolled up his sleeves. "Tell me, when do we leave?"

---

"Shidi (師弟)," Yang Xiao said, "I think we should have dinner first. There's a river nearby; we can go catch some fish, and the women can prepare them later."

He intended to discuss Tajkis's plan with Fan Yao, using this as an excuse to buy time. But before Fan Yao could even open his mouth, Tajkis said, "Tonight, we should all have dinner at the nearest tavern. I'll pay. It's almost dark, and I've been hungry for a while now."

Without waiting for Fan Yao's answer, she led the four other girls to the nearest tavern, leading their horses. However, before entering the tavern, Qi Shengniang and Yin Susu spotted Wang Jeong's entourage with his guards from a distance. To avoid unnecessary confrontation, Yang Xiao suggested finding another tavern. They headed north, arrived in Xinxiang (新鄉), and found a comfortable tavern where they could relax and have dinner.

The tavern was quite lively in the evening. They were performing a stage play, which was a very popular form of entertainment for common people at the time, enacting historical tales from ancient times. The story of Wang Mang's (王莽) rebellion was performed with a plot that struck Qi Shengniang as amusing. She had never witnessed such a play in Goryeo.

Noticing Qi Shengniang's keen interest, Fan Yao asked, "Qi Shimei (七師妹), do you know the story of this Wang Mang?"

"Shifu (師傅) once told me about it," Qi Shengniang replied, pleased that Fan Yao was paying attention. "It's just as they're telling it. According to Shifu, he was actually a rebel of the Han Dynasty."

"Actually?" Yang Xiao interjected. "He was truly a rebel! In this case, there's no 'actually'."

Tajkis clicked her tongue in annoyance. "Shige (師哥), you're disturbing our junior sister's viewing!"

Fan Yao grew curious and asked again, "What did your teacher say?"

"According to Shifu, even though he was a rebel, he was very kind to the common people," Qi Shengniang explained. "He abolished slavery and distributed land to the people, so Shifu couldn't call him evil."

"Wow, your teacher is very interesting," Fan Yao said, laughing. But he saw that Yang Xiao wasn't laughing, nor did he comment. "I'm curious, how does your teacher judge our current emperor?"


## *Xinxiang, July 1327: A Royal Revelation*

"Oh, about that, Shifu said the current emperor's kindness actually has a reason," Qi Shengniang replied, continuing to recount Douluo Jing's opinion, which was merely her Douluo Haoyu's views. "But as long as it's good for the people, why should we complain? Shifu said throughout history there's no ruler who is truly good."

"Ah!" Fan Yao said with a faint smile, "That means your teacher would also support General Bayan... I myself feel the same."

At this point, Yin Susu saw Yang Xiao's eyes light up, seemingly wanting to say something but then deciding against it. She remarked casually, "Actually, my father feels the same way, which is why I was sent to deliver something to General Bayan's residence."

"Aha!" Fan Yao exclaimed, "What is it?"

"Well, about that, I don't know myself," Yin Susu replied, laughing. "Father didn't say. Right now, Gege is in Jiangling. It seems related to this, but then again, maybe not."

"What's Yin Yewang doing there?" Yang Xiao asked, curious.

Tajkis laughed coldly. "Southern girls are indeed beautiful," she said. "Gathering new 'managers' for his gambling dens there, I suppose."

Ah Luo and Mei Jian laughed at the comment. They knew that at just eighteen years old, Yin Yewang already had a collection of many girls he sometimes brought home, even though he had just recently married and was awaiting the birth of his child.

Yin Susu knew Tajkis never liked her brother. She merely offered a thin smile, not commenting on Tajkis's sarcasm. Instead, she cleared her throat, stating concisely, "There, father is holding an art exhibition. Someone will be attending." She motioned for them all to lean closer and lowered her voice, "You must have heard the name Tugh Temür..."

Yang Xiao offered a faint smile. "That's something," he murmured, "but what about his brother, the one in the north?"

"Well, I don't know about that," Yin Susu said again. "According to father, Tugh Temür is surrounded by Han officials."

"Kusala is in the north; I think he'll be the same," Fan Yao mused, muttering, "I have a bad feeling. This is a bad omen... if these two then come into conflict, great chaos will ensue..."

Yang Xiao stated, "That's precisely what's good."

All eyes turned to him, filled with questions. "What's good about it?" Tajkis asked, her brow furrowed. "What will happen then is *war*! Are you ignorant, or just pretending to be? Right now, the Yuan Dynasty has started using extremely powerful cannons! The ones who will truly suffer are the *innocent common people*!"
