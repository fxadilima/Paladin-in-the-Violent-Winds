# Prologue
## *Henan, July 1327: The Hunyuan Thunderbolt Hand*

Initially, Qi Shengniang wanted to help Yin Susu and get to know the girl. However, with Wang Jeong also present in Kaifeng, she lost interest in that. "At least I left a useful message," she thought. Somewhat disappointed, she then decided to go to Jiangnan or some other place that caught her eye.

As she was pondering where to go, she saw a large crowd gathered in the courtyard of a luxurious house. Many soldiers were also present there. It seemed an important event had attracted their attention. From whispers among the townsfolk, she gathered that a terrible incident had just occurred at the house.

To a middle-aged woman in the crowd, she asked, "Ayi (Auntie), what happened?"

Without saying anything, the woman just pointed her finger towards the western wall of the house, where soldiers were gathered, examining something on the wall. Feeling very curious, Qi Shengniang approached, but one of the soldiers on duty stopped her, saying, "Hey, this is no business for a child. Don't come closer!"

However, at that moment, the soldiers huddled near the wall turned to move elsewhere. Qi Shengniang managed to read an inscription on the wall, seemingly written in blood, accompanied by several handprints: "*Hunyuan Pili Shou* (Primordial Unity Thunderbolt Hand) Cheng Kun killed these people."

Qi Shengniang's brow furrowed. "Who would kill so many people and then leave their name there? There's definitely something wrong!" She herself had only killed two imperial soldiers, and she was forced to flee to Zhongyuan! Judging by the number of law enforcers present, it seemed the entire household was dead. "Who is this 'Cheng Kun'? His title is so grand â€” Thunderbolt Hand! Shifu never spoke of him."

One of the men standing near her was talking to his friend, "Something like this also happened in Ling'an. The message was exactly the same!"

Another person chimed in, "My brother lives in Sichuan. He said it happened there too; now I'm seeing it for myself."

"My friend said the killer used the Qi Shang Quan (Seven Injury Punch) from the Kongtong Sect!" another person stated. "If this one's the same, then it's the same killer."

"How would your brother know that? Do these government investigators know anything about Qi Shang Quan or the Kongtong Sect?"

"The Kongtong Sect itself participated in the investigation in Sichuan," the first man said. "They then denied that they did it!"

"Hmm," Qi Shengniang thought. "They might confiscate people's weapons, but something like this can still happen, without using any weapons at all!" She suddenly grew very curious, wanting to know more about this matter. Then she suddenly recalled the conversation between Andreas and his friend in the tavern a few days earlier. "This seems like a very evil martial art. Could it be what they called the Mo Jiao...?" But then she thought again, "Didn't the Kongtong Sect themselves say this martial art originated from their sect? But what's the point of the killer leaving Cheng Kun's name?"

Suddenly, the crowd around Qi Shengniang parted, making way for a group approaching the house of the victimized family. A woman in her thirties, dressed like a nun, appeared with her disciples, most of whom were women, some men. Not all her disciples wore nun's attire. For some reason, Qi Shengniang felt an ominous aura surrounding this nun's appearance. She couldn't tell if this nun belonged to a Buddhist or a Taoist group, as both had celibate members, yet this nun's attire didn't clearly represent either. Her hair was not shaved. She held a horse-tail whisk in her right hand. This tool gave the impression that she was a follower of Taoism.

Then, secretly observing the nun's face, Qi Shengniang began to notice that the nun's eyebrows seemed to droop at both ends. This created a gloomy and cruel impression for her.

"Ssssh... Miejue Shitai (Abbess Miejue)..." whispered one of the men nearby. "Don't look at her like that, she'll kill you. She's very cruel."

"Oh," Qi Shengniang said curtly, turning her face away.

The woman called Miejue Shitai briefly observed the inscription on the western wall of the house from a distance, then snorted, said something to her disciples, turned, and left the place without doing anything.

After she left, the man who had whispered to Qi Shengniang earlier spoke again, "They must be in a hurry, wanting to know what will happen. A fierce fight between the Mo Jiao and the Emei Sect is about to occur."

Hearing the term 'Mo Jiao,' Qi Shengniang became very interested. She turned, now noticing that the man who said it was not old, around his thirties, with a medium build and a friendly face. She smiled, asking in a casual tone, hiding her curiosity, "Dage (Big Brother), how do you know?"

The man scrutinized her attire. Apparently, hearing Qi Shengniang's tone, he again thought she was from Jiangnan, and had come here merely to sightsee or was sent by her master on a task in Kaifeng. Qi Shengniang's current clothes were indeed like those of a young Wulin martial artist. She also tried to imitate a boy's voice. The man said, "Didn't your master tell you? Guhongzi challenged Yang Xiao. They will fight outside this city. I suppose Miejue Shitai appeared here also because she wants to watch that fight; that's why she ignored this matter, perhaps deeming it trivial."

"Oh," Qi Shengniang said, unable to contain her curiosity any longer. "Do you know where they will fight?"

"Well, let's head out the west gate now," the man said, gesturing for Qi Shengniang to follow him.

Qi Shengniang had never heard the names Yang Xiao or Guhongzi, but hearing the man's tone, she concluded that Yang Xiao must be a disciple of the Mo Jiao, perhaps even a high-ranking official. Guhongzi, on the other hand, was most likely a disciple of the Emei Sect. She grew curious about what this impending battle would be like.

Following the man's steps, she arrived at a pine forest on the outskirts of Kaifeng. It was already growing dark, but the moonlight was bright enough for them to see what was happening around them. Unfortunately, no one else was present yet at this location.

"Dage (Big Brother), are you sure they'll fight here?" Qi Shengniang asked.

The man smiled, pointing to their left. A group of people was stealthily approaching and observing the same open field. It was indeed Miejue Shitai and her disciples. Grinning widely, the man whispered, "Don't move recklessly, or we'll be discovered. I don't know your name yet, but my surname is Yue, and my given name is Sanguo."

"Oh, my surname is Qi," Qi Shengniang replied, returning his smile. "You can call me Sunyuan." She was forced to lie. Of course, she couldn't say her name was 'Shengniang,' which was clearly a girl's name.

"Ah, Qi Xiongdi (Brother)! I guessed it, you really are from the south," Yue Sanguo said cheerfully. He patted Qi Shengniang's shoulder rather hard, causing the small girl to cough. "My apologies, I forgot you're still small!" Yue Sanguo said, laughing. "Hey, why are you in this place? Shouldn't life be much more pleasant in Jiangnan?"

Qi Shengniang was a bit surprised by this question, but immediately said, "Dage, to be frank, I just killed a soldier in my hometown. I'm surely being hunted now, so I fled without a clear direction. They wanted to capture me for no reason; of course, I resisted. I stabbed one of them through the chest until he died, and the other wanted to seize my hand, so I slashed his neck. Of course, I can't return to my hometown."

Yue Sanguo looked very surprised by that answer. "You... you killed people...? Killed Yuan soldiers?"

Qi Shengniang thought, "Basically, Goryeo soldiers are indeed under the Yuan Dynasty now. That means they are also Yuan soldiers. Well, it's too late to take it back; this person doesn't know me anyway." She said, "I was forced to, and it wasn't really intentional. They wanted to capture me; was I supposed to just stand there? Dage, don't tell me you intend to report me."

"Oh, no," Yue Sanguo replied. "Of course not. Those bastards deserved to die." He frowned, staring intently at Qi Shengniang, then asked, "But why did they want to capture you?"

Before Qi Shengniang could answer, their ears caught the sound of very subtle footsteps approaching from the front. Qi Shengniang quickly gestured for Yue Sanguo to stay quiet. Two men appeared, entering the open field destined to be their combat arena.

Moonlight illuminated the figure of a man nearing forty, of medium build, carrying a long sword that, even from their vantage point, looked very impressive to Qi Shengniang. From a distance, a certain authoritative aura seemed to emanate from the sword. Its gleam was sharp under the moonlight, even before being unsheathed. On the sword's hilt, from a distance, their eyes could read the beautifully engraved phrase, "Yitian Jian."

"Hm, 'Yitian Jian'!" Yue Sanguo whispered. "So, it's in the hands of the Emei Sect."

With that, Qi Shengniang concluded that the man carrying the sword was Guhongzi.

The second man was tall, not bulky, with a handsome face, in his early thirties, about the same age as Yue Sanguo. He carried no weapon whatsoever. His demeanor was very calm, even somewhat cold. He was dressed entirely in black, in fabric that was quite expensive, though not ostentatious.

Guhongzi looked at his opponent with a condescending tone, saying, "Yang Xiao, stop committing evil. Disband your Mo Jiao, and return to the right path. We will not extend any further issues after this."

Yang Xiao said coldly, "The right path is Ming Jiao."

Guhongzi burst into laughter. "To me, it's all the same; the way you kill people shows the true name of your sect."

"You've been saying 'Mo Jiao,' 'committing evil,' 'returning to the right path,' and now you say we kill people, do you have proof?" Yang Xiao said flatly.

"Proof?" Guhongzi repeated. "Do you think we're as foolish as those Mongols? The ones who just killed the family in Kaifeng are clearly your people. You're trying to blame Cheng Kun? We're not defending Cheng Kun, I don't even know who he is, but trying to shift blame like that is clearly childish."

Looking up at the sky, Yang Xiao said, "It's useless to talk to a fool who won't listen to explanations. Suppose you're right, now what do you want to do?"

Guhongzi raised his sword, saying, "You seeâ€”what is this? If this sword is unsheathed, it won't return before drinking human blood."

Yang Xiao laughed coldly. "You mean, you want to command that thing to kill me?"

Guhongzi grew angry, shouting, "Stop talking nonsense, prepare to meet your doom!"

He took a stance, intending to unsheathe the sword in his hand. But, to everyone's surprise, Yang Xiao's figure transformed into a blurry black shadow; he approached Guhongzi as fast as the wind, then returned to his original spot just as quickly, laughing heartily while holding the Yitian Jian which had already changed hands. He said, "You should throw this junk into a ravine so it doesn't cause chaos in the jianghu." He unsheathed the sword. Its cold, aura-filled gleam sent shivers down Qi Shengniang's spine. But it had no effect on Yang Xiao whatsoever. He threw both the scabbard and the sword, both sticking halfway into the ground.

Without another word, Yang Xiao departed, using his *qinggong* to vanish into the darkness of the night.

They both heard Abbess Miejue sigh in the distance. The Emei Sect group emerged from their hiding place and approached Guhongzi, who stood dazed, gazing at the Yitian Jian and its scabbard half-buried in the ground, a testament to Yang Xiao's formidable internal energy and Emei's tragic defeat.

Yue Sanguo gestured for a stunned Qi Shengniang to follow him away from the spot.

"No point in peeking at someone who's already lost," Yue Sanguo said with a laugh. "I didn't expect them to lose so easily. How shameful, good thing no one else saw it."

"Yang Xiao's martial arts are truly extraordinary," Qi Shengniang said, still awestruck. "His movements are like a demon's; no wonder people call their group 'Mo Jiao'."

Yue Sanguo looked at her intently, saying, "Qi Xiongdi, you'd better be frank. Don't be afraid; I'm not your enemy. You're very young, or even still a child, yet they want to capture you. This is quite extraordinary. Unless..."

Remembering Yue Sanguo's unanswered question, Qi Shengniang just laughed. She didn't know how to answer it, as she was still pondering why King Chungsuk wanted to expedite her marriage to Wang Jeong. Of course, she couldn't tell Yue Sanguo this, as it would immediately reveal her identity as someone from Goryeo. "Unless what? Dage, what are you thinking?"

Yue Sanguo sighed again, and continued, "Unless you're involved in a rebellion against the government. But considering your age, I suppose that's also quite impossible..." He looked at Qi Shengniang intently again, then asked somewhat urgently, "Qi Xiongdi, what's your connection to the Ming Jiao?"

Qi Shengniang was surprised and retorted, "Ming Jiao? You mean what they mentioned earlier? I just heard the name now. Dage, why do you think I'm a Ming Jiao member?"

"Because usually the government only arrests a Mo Jiao member like that, without further questioning," Yue Sanguo replied. "Their sect's name is Ming Jiao, but the orthodox sects in Wulin call them Mo Jiao and usually antagonize them. Because to the government their movement is suspicious, the government gladly follows the name used by these orthodox sects and calls them 'Mo Jiao'."

Only now did Qi Shengniang understand, but she immediately shook her head and said, "I'm not a Ming Jiao member. Dage, if I were a Ming Jiao member, I'd definitely admit it."

Yue Sanguo laughed. "If you were a Ming Jiao member, you'd better not admit it. They'd arrest you immediately. Qi Xiongdi, I'm not your enemy. Nor am I an enemy of the Ming Jiao or anyone else. I don't know why they want to capture you, but I think you'd best join the Ming Jiao if you want to be safe. If you're alone, sooner or later you'll be caught, no matter how good your kung fu is. Especially since you're still too young. If you join the Ming Jiao, they'll definitely train you to become a formidable person!"

Qi Shengniang wasn't interested in becoming a formidable person. Right now, she only wanted to know the fate of her family in Haengju. But she couldn't help but laugh at the comment. "Dage, hearing your explanation, I feel like you're the real Ming Jiao member."

Yue Sanguo was stunned, then burst into laughter. "Qi Xiongdi, I must admit, you are truly very clever," he said. "You guessed correctly. But I'm just an insignificant subordinate. My advice earlier was sincere; it's up to you whether you want to listen to it or not." He pulled out an identification token from his pocket and gave it to Qi Shengniang.

Qi Shengniang saw that the object was oval-shaped but rather flat, with a convex crystal in the center that had a flaming red, engraved symbol of fire. Yue Sanguo continued, "If you give this token to a young woman named Tajkis, whom you can find west of Kunlun Shan, she will definitely help you develop. Believe me, your current troubles are truly insignificant; everything will be resolved quickly."

"Who is this Tajkis?" Qi Shengniang asked.

"She's my superior," Yue Sanguo replied. "She is indeed young, and she's of Persian descent. Don't be surprised, the Ming Jiao indeed originated from Persia. But despite her youth, her martial arts are very advanced."

"But how can I reach Kunlun Shan? That place sounds very far in the western regions," Qi Shengniang murmured, deep in thought.

Seeing Qi Shengniang's hesitation, Yue Sanguo said again, "The decision is yours. Unfortunately, I currently have a task to complete in Shangdu and can't help you much. This is all I can do. It seems we must part ways now." He clasped his hands together, then added with a smile, "Qi Xiongdi, your disguise is good, but you forgot to cover your earlobes. People can still tell you're a girl."

Qi Shengniang was stunned. For several seconds, she remained silent. Finally, she exclaimed, slapping her own thigh, "Aihh! I'm so stupid! Dage... Dage...!"

But by then, Yue Sanguo was already about thirty meters from where she stood, and two seconds later, his shadow disappeared behind the pine trees. Qi Shengniang was surprised. She thought, "If an insignificant subordinate has kung fu like this, then what about Tajkis?"

A few days later, the city residents were once again bustling, gathered to watch several prisoners being paraded towards the town square. They vied with each other to throw rotten eggs and vegetables, or small pebbles, at the prisoners, cursing them harshly. Qi Shengniang finally realized that these people were accused of oppressing the populace, corruption, or other acts against the Yuan Dynasty's law.

The local people seemed to constantly praise the firm actions of General Bayan, who was apparently their governor.

In the town square, Qi Shengniang, along with the local residents, witnessed the execution. She let out a choked scream, turning her face away and closing her eyes in shock. Around her, she still heard people shouting and cursing the dead prisoners for a while. When she opened her eyes, she briefly saw Toqto'a standing with his guards not far away. He was dressed like a young Mongolian nobleman.

Qi Shengniang abandoned her intention to greet him when one of Toqto'a's guards said, "Gongzi, the Jiangjun (General) is calling you."

"Alright, I know," the boy replied, then immediately turned to leave the place.
