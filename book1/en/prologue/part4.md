## *Henan, July 1327: The Hunyuan Thunderbolt Hand*

Initially, Qi Shengniang wanted to help Yin Susu and get to know the girl. However, with Wang Jeong also present in Kaifeng, she lost interest in that. "At least I left a useful message," she thought. Somewhat disappointed, she then decided to go to Jiangnan or some other place that caught her eye.

As she was pondering where to go, she saw a large crowd gathered in the courtyard of a luxurious house. Many soldiers were also present there. It seemed an important event had attracted their attention. From whispers among the townsfolk, she gathered that a terrible incident had just occurred at the house.

To a middle-aged woman in the crowd, she asked, "Ayi (Auntie), what happened?"

Without saying anything, the woman just pointed her finger towards the western wall of the house, where soldiers were gathered, examining something on the wall. Feeling very curious, Qi Shengniang approached, but one of the soldiers on duty stopped her, saying, "Hey, this is no business for a child. Don't come closer!"

However, at that moment, the soldiers huddled near the wall turned to move elsewhere. Qi Shengniang managed to read an inscription on the wall, seemingly written in blood, accompanied by several handprints: "*Hunyuan Pili Shou* (Primordial Unity Thunderbolt Hand) Cheng Kun killed these people."
