# Prologue

## *Baodinglu: September, 1327: The Little Fairy Comes of Age*

Tajkis arrived back in Baodinglu, where they had separated, almost simultaneously with Fan Yao, who was riding with Qi Shengniang who had already regained consciousness. The little girl still looked somewhat pale, not fully recovered, although Fan Yao found no internal injuries after examining her thoroughly. Along the way, she seemed to be holding back pain and clutching her stomach, but she only shook her head each time Fan Yao asked how she felt, answering curtly, "I'm fine."

For some reason he couldn't explain himself, Fan Yao found that answer unsatisfactory. But, as a man, he naturally couldn't examine Qi Shengniang's condition more thoroughly, as that would involve touching parts of her body that would raise questions for many.

Seeing the two from a distance, Tajkis, Mei Jian, and Ah Luo immediately greeted them boisterously, "Hey! Why did you take so long? What happened?" Ah Luo asked.

Tajkis helped Qi Shengniang dismount and led her to a tavern they were using as a meeting point. In front of the tavern, Yin Susu was waiting. "Baatar came, telling us to head west immediately, he said Xie Daxia is heading to Guangming Ding!"

"Forget that, I already know," Tajkis said.

"What happened?" Yin Susu asked again, followed by some of her companions with the same question.

Briefly, Tajkis recounted what they had heard from Xie Xun himself, and that Yang Xiao had already taken him back to Guangming Ding.

"Hm! So it really was Xie Xun who did everything," Fan Yao said, clearly very anxious. "Then what next? This makes us the guilty party! If the Ming Cult is already called the 'Demonic Cult', now it really seems like that name is true!"

But Ah Luo was focusing on another matter. She had noticed Qi Shengniang's unusual demeanor for a while. This time, too, she was just quiet, like someone holding back pain. "Qi Shimei, are you alright?"

Hearing the news about Xie Xun, Fan Yao now finally remembered Qi Shengniang's condition. He quickly said, "She took a blow from Cheng Kun, I'm worried something's wrong. You all know, I'm a man, so..."

Tajkis was very surprised. She knew Cheng Kun's epithet was 'Lightning Hand', and there must be a reason for it. Anxiously, she checked Qi Shengniang's pulse, saying, "You... where did you get hit?" She anxiously examined the little girl's entire body, but then Yin Susu's eyes widened after seeing Qi Shengniang's back, she cleared her throat, then lowered her voice, "Qi Shimei, you... is this your first time?"

Her attitude made Fan Yao suspicious. "What is it? Is she internally injured?"

Hurriedly, Yin Susu said, "Oh, no... we'll check later, don't worry." She smiled, somewhat mysteriously, which made Fan Yao even more suspicious.

But Qi Shengniang quickly said, "I'm fine, Er Shige, don't worry," her face flushing. Internally, she felt something strange. She really liked Fan Yao's attention. After saying it, she immediately regretted it. "I should have said I was in pain," she thought. She then whispered something to Tajkis and Yin Susu. Seeing her face flush, Mei Jian and Ah Luo became curious. But then they both looked towards Qi Shengniang's clothing in the back, then giggled. "Ooh... so that's what it is..." Ah Luo mumbled, taking Qi Shengniang's and Yin Susu's hands and leading them away, saying with a smile to Fan Yao, "Our Qi Shimei is growing up. It's nothing serious."

Not understanding, Fan Yao asked again after the three women left, "What was that really about? Qi Shimei took Cheng Kun's palm strike with her own. I'm worried she has internal injuries. That man's internal energy is incredibly powerful!"

Tajkis smiled faintly. "Believe me, she's fine. It's a woman's matter, you wouldn't understand," she winked her beautiful eyes, glancing at Mei Jian, before continuing, "Your concern is sweet. Er Shige, this is the kind of problem that men usually 'don't want to know' about; you just need to know it'll be sorted out... but you'll have to propose to Qi Shimei first. I can represent her family, if necessary."

Fan Yao seemed annoyed, clicking his tongue impatiently. "Tajkis, you know my feelings..."

"Oh, you have feelings too?" Tajkis interrupted. She knew what Fan Yao wanted to say, but she deliberately avoided it, continuing lightly, "Whatever you want to do, you still need money, and now is the perfect time — especially since *Da Shige* isn't here."

Quietly, Mei Jian, listening from a distance, was amused. Everyone knew Fan Yao had been in love with Tajkis from the start. Unfortunately, his feelings were unrequited; Tajkis never paid him any mind. She saw Yin Susu and Ah Luo return with Qi Shengniang, who looked much more cheerful now. Meanwhile, she heard Fan Yao saying, "Don't tell me you want to go through with that crazy plan of yours!"

"Oh, why not?" Tajkis said, her tone challenging. "This is the best opportunity. Look, those families in Dadu, Kalgan[^kalgan], and Shangdu — what a waste of their wealth! Everyone's dead, who will inherit their homes, inherit their money? Wouldn't it be better if we 'managed' it?"

"Are you crazy?" Fan Yao almost shouted. "This is taking advantage of a dire situation!"

[^kalgan]: Kalgan is the historical name for the city of Zhangjiakou.

"Oh, so you want all that to be taken over by the government?" asked Tajkis. "In my opinion, the money will naturally go to the officials, whose bellies are already too big. We will enjoy a little of it too, but the rest we can distribute to anyone who needs it. Isn't this in line with the Ming Cult's teachings – that we help those who are suffering? Those families who died, hmm... I think this way, their lives won't be in vain either, even if they never helped anyone while alive." She chuckled lightly.

"What's happening?" Yin Susu asked, intrigued. "Sounds exciting."

"Tajkis wants to rob the homes of the massacre victims," Fan Yao said, laughing dryly.

"Hey, I just want to make use of their wasted money," Tajkis retorted, defending herself.

Qi Shengniang and Ah Luo exchanged glances; they immediately understood what the two were discussing.

"I don't think there's any harm in us taking a look," Yin Susu said, her eyes sparkling. "If there's really no one there, we'll just take whatever we can carry. Wouldn't it be a waste if someone else took it?"

Qi Shengniang, ever since fleeing Haengju, had been meticulously counting her remaining supplies every day. She mostly hunted to meet her own needs. Currently, her money supply was dwindling. Hearing the idea, she immediately said, "Hey, there's no harm in this! If we don't take it, certainly someone else, or bandits, will! I don't think the government is properly guarding those houses that have lost their owners either."

"If necessary, we could even stay there," Ah Luo added lightly. She had been a street vagrant since childhood before Tajkis found her, so she wasn't afraid of ghosts at all.

Seeing everyone beginning to agree with Tajkis's plan, Fan Yao then thought, "If I just let this happen, next they'll start bothering other people's houses that still have occupants. Wouldn't that damage the Ming Cult's reputation even more if we were discovered?" He then said, "Alright, but just this once. And I won't allow you to stay there!"

Not wanting to return to Kaifeng, they then immediately continued their journey to Dadu, where three houses had already lost all their occupants.

---

During the journey to Dadu, Qi Shengniang became very close with the four other girls, who were all older than her. The oldest here was, of course, Tajkis, nearly eighteen, followed by Yin Susu, Ah Luo, and Mei Jian. A year younger than Tajkis, the petite Yin Susu looked much younger. The tall Mei Jian looked about the same age as Tajkis, while Ah Luo, with her simple appearance yet beautiful figure and naturally pretty, cheerful face, looked younger than Mei Jian. With only two years difference in age, Mei Jian and Ah Luo quickly became close with Qi Shengniang. Both were orphans; Ah Luo didn't even know her parents' names, which is why she had no surname.

An old beggar found Ah Luo by the roadside when she was still a baby and raised her until she was about five years old, calling her Ah Luo because soon after finding her, he saw a Luohan fruit tree. Since the name 'Luohan' would not be funny for a girl, he only took the character 'Luo' to call her Ah Luo.

The old beggar was not a member of the Kai Pang (Beggar Gang). He later died when Ah Luo was about five, leaving Ah Luo to live as a vagrant in Jiangnan. Sleeping wherever she could, eating from people's pity, she grew accustomed to speaking roughly and fighting anyone who bothered her.

Mei Jian was somewhat luckier, though she too ended up as a vagrant in Jiangnan. Mei Jian's parents died during a war between the Chaghatai faction, led by Esen Buqa Khan, and Ayurbarwada. She didn't know why her parents had gone to Dadu and ended up caught in fierce battles along the road to Shangdu. After her parents died, a Kai Pang member rescued Mei Jian, who was nearly five at the time, and took her to Chang'an. However, Mei Jian got into a fight with young beggar boys over food and accidentally killed three of them by throwing rocks. She then became a lone vagrant until she was found by Tajkis, when she was nearly ten. At that time, Tajkis had just arrived from Persia and was on her way to Jiangnan, sent by Yang Dingtian to visit Yin Tianzheng. Yang Xiao and Fan Yao were part of that entourage, escorting Tajkis.

Tajkis's rather eccentric personality was very appealing to Qi Shengniang. Tajkis did not hesitate to share her knowledge in all matters, not just martial arts. Tajkis possessed a wealth of knowledge concerning the history of the Ming Cult, which even Yang Xiao and Fan Yao did not know.

Most special of all, for Qi Shengniang, was Yin Susu. For some reason difficult for her to explain, Qi Shengniang always felt as if Yin Susu was her biological older sister. Yin Susu taught her everything a young girl ought to know. Having lost her mother at a young age, and coming from a well-off family herself, Yin Susu easily understood Qi Shengniang. They were both the youngest children in their families. Yin Susu taught her how to cook characteristic Jiangnan dishes, and Qi Shengniang shared recipes for Goryeo dishes that they could find ingredients for there.

The four girls styled Qi Shengniang along the way. Tajkis also changed into typical Han Chinese women's attire. They worked together to transform Qi Shengniang into a woman who looked three years older than her actual age.

It turned out that all four girls were skilled at disguise and makeup. For the first time, Qi Shengniang received makeup like an adult woman. Her hair was tied in the Han Chinese style. Tajkis, the most skilled in such matters, had bought a new set of clothes that made Qi Shengniang look more like a female martial artist, allowing her to move more freely and no longer needing to hide the fact that she was a girl. Tajkis also stored away the bow and arrows that the child had been carrying. "In the Central Plains, women generally don't use bows and arrows. A short sword is more suitable for you," she said.

When she saw her reflection in the mirror, Qi Shengniang was stunned. She didn't recognize herself at all. The reflection in the mirror looked like a woman the same age as Tajkis or Yin Susu. The clothes she wore had erased any remaining impression that she came from Goryeo. Her eyes now seemed larger. Even her own family would take a moment before recognizing her.

As they prepared to depart from the inn, Tajkis said, "We've heard tales of the prowess of the Seven Heroes of Wudang, now it's time for them all to hear about the Seven Heroes of the Ming Cult!"

Internally, Fan Yao sighed. Before, they were honorable members of the Ming Cult, but now it seemed Tajkis would turn them into petty thieves.

### *Dadu at Night: The Plan Begins**

About ten li from Dadu's western gate, they tethered their horses at the edge of a forest, then entered the city disguised as travelers from the north, as Tajkis had suggested. Fan Yao pushed a cart himself. Their belongings consisted only of clothes and various food items, plants, and roots for medicinal ingredients, which they had actually purchased around Baodinglu. The five bodyguards accompanying Yin Susu were completely unarmed and always stayed close to Fan Yao.

Seeking a cheap inn, they only booked one room for the men and another for the women. Leaving the cart at the inn with Yin Susu's bodyguards who had followed her during their time in Kaifeng, the six of them waited until sunset and the city became somewhat quiet. They spent the entire day observing the three houses they intended to target.

As Tajkis had anticipated, these houses were only sealed, not heavily guarded. From the residents nearby, they learned that the government had concluded the incidents were the work of local bandits and had made no further decisions regarding the status of the houses themselves. Some neighbors even suspected that the incidents were related to political rivalries, given that all the deceased families were Yuan Dynasty officials.

"They weren't good official families," one resident whispered, "Often, we were overtaxed. They also previously had close ties with many Lamas."

"Very interesting," Fan Yao said, after they were alone. "Perhaps Cheng Kun is curious why the government isn't suspecting this has anything to do with the Ming Cult."

Tajkis remarked lightly, "In my opinion, Yesun Temur's view is actually very healthy. He disregards all religious celebrations, which is why the Ming Cult isn't being pursued under charges of heresy right now. Er Shige, where do you think Cheng Kun's martial arts originated, why have we never heard his name?"

Qi Shengniang chuckled. "It feels like we're competing with those Lamas; maybe they're also secretly looking for an opportunity to steal property here."

Yin Susu nudged her arm, subtly gesturing with her eyes behind them, where several people dressed in rough clothing were seen walking out of a roadside tavern. Their heads were covered with Mongolian hats, but they could still see that their heads were bald.

"Hmm, tonight... seems like it's going to be very interesting..." Fan Yao mumbled.

After midnight, they finally saw an opportunity to approach the three houses safely. Fan Yao approached the westernmost house with Qi Shengniang, Tajkis and Mei Jian approached the eastern house, while Yin Susu and Ah Luo approached the southern house.

The two Tibetan monks who had been hit looked at their companions, rather annoyed. One whispered, "At a time like this, you're still joking around?"

"Who's joking?"

Suddenly, they heard a sound from behind the main building, not very loud, but in the quiet night, a porcelain item falling from the roof would certainly startle someone stealthily breaking into another's house to steal. "Hey, what was that?"

"Let's check first," said his companion. "What if there are some guards back there?"

"Hah, those stupid guards, can't you handle them?" another friend sneered. "Let Xiaosheng go there now! All of you wait here."

He turned and went around to the back of the house alone. However, after waiting for several minutes, he didn't return. One of the ten monks began to get agitated, saying, "This is taking too long, it seems..."

"Aaahhh!" a startled scream was heard from their companion's direction behind the house, followed by the sound of breaking porcelain as before, then two loud 'Thumps!', 'Thumps!' and silence returned, before a mournful, hair-raising wolf howl echoed through the night.

Daring themselves, the other nine monks stealthily rushed to the back courtyard of the house, moving along the western side.

Upon reaching the rear courtyard of the main building, they saw no sign of their companion. The broken pieces of a porcelain object, resembling a small jar, were clearly visible on a large rock not far from the house entrance.

"Hey, where's that idiot Dumbul?" asked one of them, who had previously been hit by Qi Shengniang's throw.

"Langna, take a peek inside the house, maybe he went in to check," another said.

Hesitating for a moment, the monk called Langna finally said to his large companion, "Goe Lang, I'll go in first, you follow behind me. This is very suspicious."

Carefully, Langna approached the quite large and tall entrance, attempting to push it open. The door creaked as it opened. But, unexpectedly, a medium-sized jar fell from above the door, hitting Langna squarely on the head and spilling its contents. Langna cursed, "Damn it! This is urine!"

Angrily, he turned to utter more curses, pointing his finger towards the dark interior of the room, but then a wooden plank swung from the left side of the door, hitting his face squarely. He immediately fainted.

Goe Lang immediately realized that the plank must have been the work of someone playing a trick on them. But the next second, he was startled by a figure that suddenly appeared, inverted, head down. The woman's long hair hung disheveled. Her face was deathly pale. The moonlight from outside revealed her tongue sticking out, with a neck that seemed to show traces of a rope strangulation mark.

Fundamentally, despite his large physique, Goe Lang had little courage. He had been scared ever since seeing Langna get hit by the jar full of urine. Now, he was startled by a sight that seemed like a vengeful ghost after suicide or execution, especially in a place that had indeed been inhabited by a large family who were all recently murdered. Instantly, his courage plummeted sharply, approaching zero. He bolted towards the courtyard where his seven companions were waiting, screaming hysterically, "Ghost... ghost!"

This time, their thin, small companion, who appeared to be the group's leader, who could be called Skamlo, said irritably, "There are no ghosts here! You're being played by someone; how can you be so foolish? There must be bandits hiding inside, trying to scare us. All of you, follow me!"

Skamlo led his seven companions, including Goe Lang, to approach the house door, bracing for the next surprise. Their fists clenched as Skamlo slowly pushed the door, which had closed again.

The door opened, revealing two figures in yellow robes standing silently facing them. Without further thought, the eight men launched their respective punches. Some aimed for the face, stomach, hands, and feet, intending to incapacitate these tough opponents as quickly as possible.

To their utter shock, the two figures offered no resistance whatsoever. All attacks landed squarely on their targets. While they were still stunned, after realizing that their 'opponents' were actually Langna and Dumbul, their own companions, two pairs of hands consecutively reached out from behind Dumbul and Langna. These two pairs of hands delivered continuous blows to the foreheads of each monk, then swiftly struck acupuncture points on their necks. In just five seconds, everyone had been incapacitated.

---

The house to the south was the last one Xie Xun visited. It wasn't as large as the other two. Yin Susu and Ah Luo had absolutely no difficulty clearing out all the Yuan Dynasty banknotes they could find inside. They carried two wooden chests full of gold and silver directly to the cart they had left outside the inn. Yin Susu's five bodyguards, who were members of the Ming Cult's Five-Element Banners, guarded it.

Conversely, as soon as Tajkis and Mei Jian set foot in the courtyard of the house to the east, they were immediately attacked by ten local bandits who also wanted to rob its contents.

All these people were armed with sharp weapons. Since they hadn't brought any weapons themselves, Tajkis grabbed a pair of clotheslines and used them as whips, throwing one to Mei Jian. She whispered, "These people are ruining our plan. Don't engage them, let's go!"

After that, they began to fight the ten bandits, creating a noisy commotion that immediately attracted the attention of a passing patrol. From outside, shouts were heard. Tajkis exclaimed, "Fools! You're waking up the whole city; this way, none of us will get anything!" She shouted loudly, "Here! There's a robbery in here!"

Pulling Mei Jian's hand, she then ran towards the back of the house and leaped over the wall. They failed to take anything from that large house.
