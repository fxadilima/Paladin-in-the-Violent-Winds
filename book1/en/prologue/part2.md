## *Haengju, December 1324: A Little Fairy Soars*

The content of the "mere" eighteen stances proved far more difficult to grasp than Douluo Jing had initially imagined. He frowned, tracing his father's writing on one of the book's pages. "Forget Ki Son-yeo," he thought, "even I don't easily understand the meaning of all this." How would this child ever learn it later?

But his attention was immediately drawn to the term "Feilong Zai Tian" (飛龍在天), the name of the second stance among the eighteen. This was an ancient proverb, depicting a flying dragon in the sky, capable of finding exceptional individuals below. From its unique vantage point, the dragon would have a clear view of worldly affairs, thus being able to track the footsteps of those with good intentions and wisdom.

Connecting all of this to Ki Son-yeo, he chuckled to himself. His father was quite something, he thought, this isn't a Flying Dragon in the Sky, but a Little Fairy Soaring (小精靈在天).
