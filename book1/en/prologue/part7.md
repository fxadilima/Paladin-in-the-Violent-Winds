# Prologue
## *Beshbalik, October 1327: A Little Fairy in the Western Regions*

"Caelina, time to eat, don't talk to yourself in the river!" a middle-aged man called out to his granddaughter, who was sitting by the riverbank, observing the aquatic animals darting back and forth, trying to get closer to the water's surface.

They lived in a simple wooden house on the outer ring of Beiting, in the western regions. Caelina's parents had died in a raid by Chagatai soldiers on her grandfather's hometown, about a hundred *li* north of their current residence. Only the grandfather and granddaughter survived their family.

Yerkin, Caelina's grandfather, was originally from a family of Ming Jiao followers. His father, Aibek, was even appointed an official when Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty's governing system in this place, naming it Wucheng (五城), also known as Beshbalik. But because the government was unstable and constantly disputed with the Chagatai faction, most people still called their region 'Beiting', a name used since ancient times. As an adult, Yerkin himself eventually met an Eastern Church pastor and was baptized, following in his grandfather's footsteps.

After that, Yerkin also tried to work as a government official by taking the state examinations organized by the Yuan Dynasty, but unfortunately, the Chagatai faction, which more often controlled his residential area, paid no heed to this. He then considered moving to Zhongyuan, following the advice of many from his tribe. However, tragically, his son's newly married family with a child suffered a great calamity. Their village was led by a headman who tended to oppose both the Chagatai faction and the Yuan Dynasty, and eventually, the village was raided by the Chagatai, who mistook them all for Yuan Dynasty supporters. Everyone in the village was mercilessly slaughtered. Fortunately, Yerkin managed to escape with Caelina.

They were eventually saved by an old Latin Church pastor who had lived there since Marco Polo returned to Venice. The pastor had originally come when he was young, with Marco Polo's entourage. This pastor eventually baptized Caelina. When the old pastor himself finally passed away, Yerkin occupied his simple dwelling with his granddaughter. He lost interest in going to Zhongyuan after hearing about the constant disputes between factions there.

Actually, in the past, they secretly had a protector, who would certainly have secured their family, had this event occurred at that time. This protector was none other than the legendary Yang Guo, who, having received the title of 'The Western Hero' from his godfather Ouyang Feng, as suggested by Huashan meeting, quietly dedicated himself and Xiaolongnu to safeguarding the balance and justice in these vast Western Regions. For decades, their unseen presence deterred many from openly committing atrocities, maintaining a fragile peace.

But when the Chagatai raided their village at that time, Yang Guo and Xiaolongnu had not appeared for a very long time. It was most likely that they had already passed away. There was no news of where their family subsequently lived. Some said they had retreated into seclusion in the Kunlun Mountains, others that they had moved to Sichuan, but no one had ever seen their family again.

Currently, while enjoying lunch with her beloved grandfather, who was her only family, Caelina took a round loaf of bread baked by her grandfather, filling the center with pieces of lamb, and said cheerfully, "Yeye, the Memet family across the river just found two baby boys. They adopted them, but gave them Han names. Isn't that funny?"

Her grandfather laughed. "Perhaps someone left their children there, but left a note saying the children were of Han descent. It's possible, why not? Xiao Xiannu[^xiao-xiannu], have you seen them?"

[^xiao-xiannu]: Xiao Xiannu (小仙女), "Little Fairy".

"Yes," Caelina replied, laughing and showing her neat, white teeth. Her sparkling eyes and cheerful demeanor always comforted Yerkin. Caelina seemed like a little fairy far removed from this world, as if she had come from a fairy tale, which is why he sometimes called her 'Xiao Xiannu'. "They do look like Han children, but their noses seem big, and their eyes are big too, just like Yeye!"

Yerkin laughed again, this time truly amused. "So you think all Han children have small eyes and noses? Next time, Yeye will take you to Quanzhou; there you'll meet many children just like them." He concluded that the found children must be from mixed families of Han and Western Region descendants, Persian or Arab. Many such families were found in Quanzhou. One of their neighbors also came from there, with characteristics similar to what his granddaughter described.

"Quanzhou?" Caelina repeated, full of curiosity. "Isn't that in Zhongyuan? Yeye, how about we go there tomorrow?"

"Caelina," her grandfather said, smiling, "Zhongyuan is very far from here." He sighed, then continued with a look of relief, "Thankfully, that way we'll be safe... But Yeye is getting old now, maybe another time, if some of our family comes to visit, you can go there with them. But would you have the heart to leave Yeye alone here?"

Caelina shook her head. "No, Hai'er will not leave Yeye! Yeye must come too, or Hai'er won't go." She then returned to her new baby friends, "Yeye, unfortunately, that family intends to send both children to Shaolin[^shaolin], they said it was to protect them later."

[^shaolin]: The Shaolin referred to here is the Shaolin in the western regions, not the Shaolin in Henan.

"Xiao Xiannu," her grandfather said, holding back a smile, recalling something that now made him feel protected himself. "There is nothing that truly guarantees one's safety. That's why Allah says in the holy book, 'For when I am weak, then I am strong.'[^quote-1] Because the one who made everything under this heaven is Allah. He is far greater than everything else. So, if we seek refuge in Allah, who else can harm us?"

[^quote-1]: Yerkin in this instance is quoting the Apostle Paul's letter in 2 Corinthians 12:10.

But as he said it, he realized his granddaughter was still too young to understand what he was saying. He then smiled when he saw Caelina looking at him with questioning eyes, asking, "Yeye, does that mean Allah is bigger than this mountain?"

"Oh, of course," Yerkin replied. "This mountain is just one of His creations."

"Yeye says Allah can raise the dead," Caelina said again. "Why doesn't Allah raise father and mother?"

Yerkin now fell silent, for he truly didn't know how he should answer this seemingly simple question. But he knew clearly about another version of 'resurrection' that was currently happening, not too far from here. The Chagatai faction was now supporting another candidate leader, one of the sons of Khayishan, the deceased Yuan Dynasty Emperor and Great Khan, who had a completely different political alignment from the current emperor. Kusala, the person they supported, had a very charismatic personality—attracting many of his father's supporters. For Yerkin, this kind of situation could be a good thing, but it could also be the seed of disaster for many.

Initially, Yesun Temur would, of course, appoint his own son as crown prince, his future successor. But, currently surrounding him were quite a number of generals who were actually loyal supporters of Khayishan and Ayurbarwada. Even now, these people were deeply dissatisfied with Yesun Temur's 'allocation of shares,' which prioritized Christians and Muslims, like Daulat Shah and his companions. One could immediately guess what would happen after Yesun Temur himself eventually passed away. At present, Dagi was already dead, but Yesun Temur's own empress, Babukhan, was just as ambitious as Dagi!

At this point, Yerkin unconsciously made the sign of the cross while praying silently. He murmured, "Xiao Xiannu, Allah does raise the dead... so your father and mother will surely rise too... though Yeye doesn't know when they will rise..."

Shenqiu, June 1328: Birth of the First Dragon
In this Year of the Dragon, in Shenqiu, Henan, far from the abode of Caelina and her grandfather, the Li family was celebrating the birth of their first son. The child's father was commonly called 'Li Xiansheng,' though he himself was not of Han descent. His mother was a local Han woman, but his father belonged to the Naiman tribe, long since subjugated by Genghis Khan. His ancestors had participated in Genghis Khan's struggle against the Jin people, back when Guo Jing was young. But this story only circulated within their own family, as Li Xiansheng's ancestors were never appointed high officials in the government of Genghis Khan or his grandson, Kublai Khan, despite their eventual relocation to Henan.

Some people associated Li Xiansheng's ancestors with Mukhali, who was a great general of Genghis Khan. But Li Xiansheng quickly said, "Aiyooo! If my ancestors had such great achievements, how am I now merely selling food in Shenqiu? At least my father would have been a Zhangguan!"

"Li Xiansheng," said his friend, a roasted pork seller, "This year is the Year of the Dragon! Looking at your son's face, I think Buddha is granting your wish; he will become a Zhangguan someday!"

Li Xiansheng glanced at his wife with a meaningful look. His wife, a woman of mixed Han and Merkit descent, lightly said to the roasted pork seller, "Ah Qiu, we're already lucky we weren't forbidden to marry, and now this child is born. Don't dream too big!"

Ah Qiu's wife, a woman from Jiangnan, said enthusiastically, "Hey, speaking of 'big dreams,' take a look at the person who is currently in Jiangling. There are rumors that our governor is supporting him to 'rise up,' you know what I mean, of course..."

Li Xiansheng was greatly startled, placing a finger to his own mouth. "This shouldn't be discussed casually! You're putting all of us in a dangerous position; we could be arrested!"

Ah Qiu nudged his wife's arm. "Li Xiansheng is right. Tell your other friends to keep quiet!" He leaned closer to Li Xiansheng and his wife, whispering, "But it's very serious. I myself feel Bayan is a bit excessive this time... The important thing is that the Huang Shang doesn't forbid people from embracing any religion, even if he doesn't celebrate it himself. Why should Bayan or El Temur interfere with the government?"

"Now, that's another name, also dangerous for us to mention," Li Xiansheng said, vigilant. "In short, this kind of conversation must not leak out, or we will all lose our lives!"

Ah Qiu clucked his tongue. "Li Xiansheng, unfortunately, there are other people who are too brave. I even heard they are already around Shangdu, waiting for this summer; the Huang Shang will surely go there, then..." He moved his hand towards his own neck, continuing, "Kkekk! You know what I mean..."

"Wow!" Li Xiansheng said, shocked, glancing anxiously at his wife.

Li Xiansheng's wife hugged her newborn baby, only a few days old, kissing his cheek and whispering, "Tingrui, study hard when you grow up, don't become a soldier..."

Secretly, in Li Xiansheng's mind, flashed the ancestral stories of his forefathers who had been involved in the struggles with Genghis Khan, long before Kublai Khan established this Yuan Dynasty. Initially, Li Xiansheng's ancestors had moved to this region from Beiting, even before that area was controlled by the Yuan Dynasty. They felt increasingly uncomfortable because Beiting at that time was inherited by Chagatai from Genghis Khan, after he subdued Khwaresmia, whereas his ancestors, who were Christians, preferred Tolui, considering Tolui's wife, Sorghaghtani Beki, was also a Christian.

In Henan, Li Xiansheng's family eventually followed the prevailing trends and gradually became Buddhists, like many others from their tribe. But his ancestors were initially hesitant. Kublai Khan initially had many followers of Han descent, from the beginning of his struggle in the territory that was originally part of the Jin Empire. Then a great rebellion broke out against him, starting with a Han man who was given funds by Kublai Khan to aid his struggle against Jia Sidao, whom many Han people considered very corrupt. Unexpectedly, Li Tai, Kublai's trusted official, later defected to the Southern Song Dynasty and fought against him. From that moment on, Kublai began to doubt all Han people, and eventually implemented laws that many considered highly insulting to the Han, although Li Xiansheng's ancestors believed that this was never intended to be against the Han people themselves.

Despite this, both the rules and rituals at Kublai's court still maintained the Han style, even until now. Finally, slowly but surely, his ancestral family began to withdraw from military and political affairs.

Now, Ah Qiu's remark about the 'Year of the Dragon' and his wife's hope for Tingrui continued to echo in Li Xiansheng's ears.

---

Yesun Temur Khan was by no means old, barely thirty-five at this time. Yet, since the previous year, his Empress, Babukhan, had been quietly spreading word that they were seeking a consort for their eldest son, Ragibagh, who was only seven years old. This move raised suspicions that Babukhan intended to seize power through her son. This was the very news that reached King Chungsuk in Goryeo, leading to Qi Shengniang being sent to Dadu as one of the Goryeo candidates.

After settling the affairs of the massacred Xie Xun family, whose properties coincidentally fell within their 'territory' according to the agreement with Fang Dongbai, Qi Shengniang learned of this matter through local gossip. She also witnessed the procession of young women being sent from Goryeo to Shangdu as 'tribute' for the Yuan Dynasty. She shrewdly concluded that the letter read by the Goryeo palace eunuch must have been the machinations of Wang Jeong, who desired her for himself, disregarding his father's orders. This was why Wang Jeong himself was eventually sent to Dadu as punishment.

Qi Shengniang was furious, especially after she repeatedly saw Wang Jeong and his guards appearing in Zhangjiakou and Shangdu. She longed for revenge, but Fan Yao and her other martial siblings forbade her from acting.

Finally, Tajkis (Qi Shengniang's other name, as implied by the narrative) had a new idea to toy with Wang Jeong and his guards. She lured them into a forest, then stripped them naked after confiscating all their valuables. They accomplished this by disguising themselves as members of a local bandit group called 'Jujing Bang' (巨鯨幫), literally "Giant Whale Gang." After thoroughly humiliating her childhood nemesis, Qi Shengniang felt utterly satisfied.

However, this incident made it difficult for Fan Yao to persuade Tajkis to return to Guangming Ding. Tajkis's ideas began to expand. First, she found excuses by naming several officials rumored to be deeply corrupt, intending to raid their homes simply to 'teach them a lesson.' But the number of officials Tajkis deemed corrupt grew daily, even extending to Shangdu. This ultimately caused them to remain in the outer reaches of Zhangjiakou to this day.

---

The news of Yesun Temur Khan's sudden death on August 15th, 1328, sent immediate shockwaves through the region, reaching Tajkis and her gang amidst their 'redistribution' efforts. This unexpected turn of events, far from being a setback, presents a colossal opportunity for them.

While they were preoccupied with their increasingly audacious 'confiscations'—a venture Fan Yao felt had spiraled out of control—whispers from Shangdu reached them on August 16th. Yesun Temur, it was said, had passed away the day before, the cause unknown.

"Heart attack, probably!" guessed a tavern owner, quickly dismissed by a street food vendor. "No way, he was so healthy, and still young! This must be a conspiracy between Babukhan and those corrupt ministers!"

"Not quite," interjected another patron. "You know as well as I do, there's Kusala in the north, and his younger brother, Tugh Temur, in the south! Lately, Tugh Temur has been gaining strong support from the Han people!"

"Ugh, this could also be the work of El Temur or General Bayan!"

"It's clearly Bayan," stated an Arab merchant, just returned from the south. "He's already powerful in Jiangxi. And you all know who's in Jiangling now, don't you?"

Swiftly, both public opinion and the views of the Grand Council members became fragmented. For everyone in Shangdu and its vicinity, Daulat Shah quickly seized interim leadership with his supporters.

"Damn it," Tajkis muttered, once they were safely away from the chattering crowds in taverns and marketplaces, all abuzz with theories about Yesun Temur Khan's sudden death. "Now we're caught between a rock and a hard place." She turned to Yin Susu. "Shimei, your father supports Tugh Temur, and I myself support Kusala. But if either of them rises, aren't we also just opening the door for the Chagatai factions or those scoundrel military men like El Temur or General Bayan? And if we try to stop them, then Daulat Shah and his gang of bastards will seize power, exploiting Babukhan, that Dagi-like empress? We're damned if we do, and damned if we don't!"

"I think we should hold our horses," Fan Yao advised. "Let's see what unfolds first."

"Wait for what?" Mei Jian scoffed. "Fang Dongbai and his cronies will surely beat us to it!"

Ah Luo snorted. "They dare?"

Yin Susu then saw two of her guards hurrying towards them, carrying a rather large wooden box. "Xiaojie, this arrived from Yue Sanguo. They said it's extremely important!"

They had almost forgotten that name. Tajkis immediately questioned, "What is it? Where is Yue Sanguo?"

The two Ming Cult members opened the wooden box, revealing its contents: a collection of books. After a quick glance, Fan Yao handed them to Tajkis. "Hmm! Looks like only you can read these!"

Tajkis needed no more than five seconds to recognize the writing as Persian. She spoke softly, "Huh? These are the personal notes of Rashid al-Din Hamadani!" She began flipping through more pages, exclaiming, "They're the source materials he used for writing Jami al-Tawarikh! Wow, this is a major discovery!" Turning to Yin Susu's guards, she demanded, "Where is Yue Sanguo? I need to speak with him!"

"Head for Karakorum, something significant is happening there. Here, they'll soon announce Ragibagh as Khan and Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty," a Ming Cult member reported.

"Hm!" Yin Susu exclaimed, surprised. "Shijie, my father's network in Dadu must be mobilizing to welcome Tugh Temur!"

"Oh, this is disastrous!" Fan Yao declared. "This means war! It's Empress Babukhan and Daulat Shah's faction against Tugh Temur, El Temur, and General Bayan's faction!"

Tajkis turned to Yin Susu, Ah Luo, Mei Jian, and Qi Shengniang, her voice urgent. "You all, go to Dadu immediately! Intercept them, don't let them move freely towards Shangdu!"

Yin Susu was stunned. "Shijie, how can we speak with these powerful officials?"

"Figure it out yourselves," Fan Yao interjected, clearly supporting Tajkis's proposal. "Yin Yewang will be there too. Whatever you do, just don't let them enter Shangdu or move north, or there will be a direct clash with Daulat Shah's side!"

"Then where are you going, Er Shige?" Qi Shengniang asked, wanting to stay with Fan Yao.

Tajkis clicked her tongue, impatient. "The two of us will join Yue Sanguo; he must be looking for Kusala! We'll do the same!" She handed the chest of books back to Yin Susu's guards. "Take these with you, don't lose them. We'll meet back here!"

Fan Yao added, "Tell our people to avoid the areas around the city gates or the Great Wall! This isn't just about swords or spears anymore; now everyone is playing with cannons!"

---

Yin Susu, leading her three martial sisters and the guards transporting their treasures and Rashid al-Din's books towards Dadu, soon faced the Beggars' Gang members who had been severely wounded earlier, their earlobes severed by Mei Jian. Smuggling the treasures was difficult enough; now they were compounded by these vengeful Beggars' Gang members. Fang Dongbai was not among them.

As soon as they saw Mei Jian, despite her tall stature and the entirely different attire she wore—a veil and mask as advised by Tajkis—they immediately recognized her. "Friends, it's the Demoness! They were supposed to only occupy the western and northern territories, but now they've broken the agreement! Strike them all down, don't let a single piece of gold escape!"

"Fools!" Mei Jian cried. "We don't want to be here anymore; a massive war is about to break out. If you still want to live, get lost! Don't block our way!"

The approximately one hundred individuals ignored Mei Jian's words and immediately surrounded the four young girls from all directions. As before, their Transmission Elder stood outside the circle to give commands, "Dog-Beating Formation!"

The sound of bamboo staffs hitting the ground echoed like war drums, filling the edge of the small pine forest.

"Yin Wufu, Yin Wulu, Yin Wushou, protect these camels!" Yin Susu shouted. "Cheng Chaofeng, Feng Gongying, signal the others!" She turned to the three other young girls, "Shimei Men, let's smash these bastards now!" She charged first towards a three-bag Beggars' Gang member who was circling them and thrust her bamboo staff towards his camel's chest. The man was startled to see a sword tip suddenly appear before his face; he immediately pulled back his staff and leaped backward.

As Yin Susu moved north, the three other girls immediately scattered south, east, and west, leaping off their respective camels. A fierce, uneven battle ensued.

Mei Jian quickly killed two beggars with sword thrusts to their throats, then lopped off the earlobes of three other beggars who surrounded her.

This time, Ah Luo was not joking at all. As soon as she leaped down, she flashed around five nearby beggars. The five beggars felt no pain at all as Ah Luo's sword sliced through vital blood vessels in their necks. As soon as they realized it, they collapsed to the ground, no longer moving, blood spurting from the small wounds.

Ten beggars only saw a blurred blue shadow as Qi Shengniang slid from her camel's back. She consecutively executed seven moves of her master's Maiden of Yue Sword Style with incredibly beautiful movements. But her opponents had no chance to admire their beauty. Four were sent sprawling several meters backward by Qi Shengniang's left and right leg kicks, while four others still managed to see the glint of the girl's long sword slicing their necks. The next second, they collapsed to the ground. Qi Shengniang quickly approached ten other beggars who were moving to surround her from all directions.

A few minutes later, suddenly, a green shadow flashed towards a group of beggars surrounding Yin Susu. What all her companions saw was about fifteen of those individuals violently ramming their heads into each other's. A man's cackle resonated loudly as Wei Yixiao stood before the fifteen beggars he had just felled, spitting onto the ground. "Pah! I'm thirsty; it's time for a drink!"

He leaped forward, grabbing the collar of one beggar while striking down his friend who was trying to interfere. Horrified screams were heard as Wei Yixiao bit the man's neck and drank his blood for a moment. Then he wiped the remaining blood from his lips, wiggled his hands as if satisfied after a good meal at a noodle stall, and shouted loudly, "Aiyo! Zhou Dian, Leng Qian, Shuobude, you're taking forever!"

Only three names were called, but then five very eccentric-looking individuals appeared in the middle of the fighting arena from atop several trees.

Seeing their arrival, the Transmission Elder immediately shouted, "Everyone retreat!"

Without needing a second command, the surviving beggars immediately turned and fled the scene.

"Eh, why the hurry to run?" Zhou Dian yelled, brandishing a roasted dog thigh in his hand. "You haven't even tried my food yet!"

"Wei Fuwang, Zhou Xiansheng!" Yin Susu greeted, cupping her hands. "Fan Youshi and Tajkis Shijie are heading to Karakorum to prevent Kusala from coming; we ourselves are heading to Dadu. Have you heard what happened?"

"Fusheng Wuliang Tianzun[^fusheng-wuliang-tianzun]," Zhang Zhong murmured, cupping his hands. "What cannot be prevented, we should ignore. We do what we can and what is most urgent."

[^fusheng-wuliang-tianzun]: Fusheng Wuliang Tianzun (福生無量天尊), a common phrase uttered by Taoists when encountering things that move their hearts. Similar to 'Praise God', 'Alhamdulillah', 'Amituofo', etc. The literal meaning of this term is roughly 'Blessed be the boundless heavenly venerate'.

"Amituofo, Shuobude, Shuobude..." Shuobude said. His round face became even rounder as he smiled.

Peng Yingyu merely smiled faintly, saying lightly, "No one can predict death, just as no one can predict when fortune arrives."

Something in Peng Yingyu's tone piqued Qi Shengniang's attention, but she couldn't explain exactly what it was. She felt a shiver of fear watching Wei Yixiao drink blood, respectful awe at Zhang Zhong's solemn demeanor, and bewildered by Leng Qian's silence. But she immediately took a liking to Shuobude's style, finding him the most amusing. She quickly commented, "Dashi, what is it that 'cannot be said'?"[^shuobude]

[^shuobude]: Shuobude (說不得)'s habit of using this term, which literally means 'cannot be said,' gave him his nickname, in addition to 'Budai Heshang' (布袋和尚), meaning 'Monk with a Cloth Sack'.

Shuobude bowed respectfully, saying in his characteristic style, "Xiao Shizhu[^xiao-shizhu], if it cannot be said, then it cannot be said, that is why Pinseng is Shuobude."

[^xiao-shizhu]: Xiao Shizhu (小施主), "Little Benefactor/Donor."

"Aiyaaa, Shuobude, what's all this Nu Shizhu[^nu-shizhu], Xiao Shizhu? This child is clearly Tajkis's new disciple," Zhou Dian interjected. He approached Qi Shengniang, extending a roasted dog thigh, and asked, "Do you dare to eat this?"

[^nu-shizhu]: Nu Shizhu (女施主), "Female Benefactor/Donor."

In Goryeo, Qi Shengniang often ate dog meat with Douluo Jing and her master. Even after her master passed away, Douluo Jing still frequently offered her this food. Of course, she was delighted, smiling broadly and saying, "Why wouldn't I dare?" She extended her hand, accepted the dog thigh that Zhou Dian broke off, and ate it with relish. Wiping the grease from her lips, she said cheerfully, "Xiansheng, don't forget to invite me if you have more of this!"

"Eeeh, Xiao Yaonu[^xiao-yaonu]," Zhou Dian said, grinning widely, thoroughly pleased with Qi Shengniang's demeanor. "You seem more suited to be married to that stinky brat — Fan Yao, where is he?"

[^xiao-yaonu]: Xiao Yaonu (小妖女), "Little Witch."

Qi Shengniang's three martial sisters giggled. Qi Shengniang herself felt her face suddenly flush crimson for an inexplicable reason. Zhou Dian's blunt remark had inadvertently exposed a secret in Qi Shengniang's heart that she hadn't even realized herself. If someone else had uttered it, perhaps the impact wouldn't have been so profound.

Yin Susu, upon seeing Qi Shengniang flustered, realized what had happened. She quickly said with a smile, "Zhou Xiansheng, Qi Shimei is still young; don't speak carelessly."

"No one said that," Peng Yingyu said, smiling faintly. "How about this: Wei Fuwang retrieves Fan Youshi and Tajkis, and all of us will wait on the outer ring of Dadu, in an abandoned house Wei Fuwang already knows. Let the belongings stay with us. The camels too. Then we'll all depart for Guangming Ding together from here."

Wei Yixiao immediately accepted the agreement. He swiftly used his qinggong to chase after Fan Yao and Tajkis to the north, while the others followed Peng Yingyu into Dadu and rested in the designated abandoned house.

The journey to Dadu gave everyone an opportunity to get to know each other, especially Qi Shengniang, who was a new member.


## *Dadu, September 1328: War Between Two Capitals*

Outside the abandoned house Peng Yingyu had found, a group of soldiers marched towards the city gate in neat, combat-ready formation. Several people around them praised General Bayan and spoke enthusiastically with other onlookers also observing the scene. It seemed the city's residents were very confident in their city's defense and showed no fear upon hearing news of the recent invasion from the north.

Qi Shengniang and the others listened to the comments around them without speaking.

"Bayan has thirty thousand soldiers at the city gate, complete with cannons," one of them said.

"From Liaodong, it's said support troops have also been prepared..." another added.

"In short, the forces from the east are combat-ready!"

"Burkha Temur and Orlug Temur are ready to provide support..."

"What if they turn towards Henan?"

"They can't possibly reach Henan; Bayan will intercept them at the border!"

"But Dadu is in great chaos right now! How can you be sure we'll win?"

Ah Luo smiled and whispered to Qi Shengniang, "Qi Shimei, it looks like that scoundrel Wang Jeong is busy saving himself right now; he wouldn't have time to bother you?"

"I think he'll go back to Goryeo soon," Yin Susu said, chuckling. "Hey, why don't we set up our own cooking equipment here? The kitchen can still be used, right?"

The abandoned house Peng Yingyu found was indeed quite large. Although its rooms looked dismal, the kitchen area appeared undamaged. The stove and tables could be used to prepare food for everyone, and the cooking utensils were still complete and could be easily cleaned for reuse.

While everyone worked together to clean the kitchen and the room they could comfortably gather and eat in, Mei Jian went into the city for groceries.

Shuobude said, "Amituofo, your presence is indeed a great blessing to us. But there's no need to buy expensive ingredients; plain mantou is enough for us."

Zhou Dian interjected, "Not enough for me. Shuobude, if you want to eat mantou alone, go ahead, but I want pork leg and nose!"

Mei Jian granted his wish. Not only pork, but Mei Jian also bought lamb, eggs, vegetables, wine, and poultry. She carried a full sack of ingredients as easily as Shuobude carried his sack. This display of Mei Jian's physical strength seemed very impressive to everyone. "No wonder you're known as the Ear-Cutting Demoness out there," Zhou Dian said, laughing heartily.

At this point, Peng Yingyu suddenly asked, "Miss Qi, you were hit by Cheng Kun's palm strike. Is there still any lingering injury?"

Zhang Zhong, who specialized in medicine, furrowed his brow. "Cheng Kun's internal energy is very strong; let Pindao examine you!"

But after examining Qi Shengniang's pulse, he found no signs of internal injury. In fact, he then said, "Hmm, it seems Miss Qi possesses a very pure foundation of Taoist internal energy! This is excellent! No wonder you're unharmed. Who taught you?"

"My Shifu was originally a disciple of Senior Yelu Qi," Qi Shengniang replied, grinning widely. "According to Shifu, Yelu Qi's kung fu was taught by Zhou Botong, so it's indeed a Taoist lineage."

"Oh!" the five Ming Cult officials exclaimed in unison.

Yin Susu said, "Qi Shimei, let's prepare all this food. Let Ah Luo and Mei Jian prepare the meatless dishes, and we'll make zongzi the way people from Jiangnan do! Peng Dashi and Shuobude Dashi can eat sweet, meatless zongzi."

While enjoying the food prepared by the four young girls, Peng Yingyu observed Qi Shengniang intently, then slowly said, "Strange, Pinseng feels an aura of the Dragon emanating from Miss Qi..."

His remark was met with laughter from everyone. Qi Shengniang often heard Douluo Haoyu's stories about the Empress Wu Zetian. Her master's stories never gave the impression that Wu Zetian was cruel, ruthless, or oppressive to the people. She said, "According to Shifu, it's unlikely there will ever be a second Wu Zetian in this world. Besides, my Shifu said the animal called 'Dragon' doesn't actually exist. So Dashi must be mistaken."

Almost everyone believed Peng Yingyu was only joking. Zhou Dian laughed lightly, saying, "Aiyaaa! Yatou (little girl), don't take Peng Yingyu's words seriously. He said one day I'd get bitten by a dog because I often eat dog meat. Hmm! To this day, all dogs are scared of me! If they dare come close, I'll be the one biting them!"

Yin Susu, Ah Luo, and Mei Jian eagerly competed to fill Qi Shengniang's bowl with various meats and eggs. Ah Luo said, "I actually want Qi Shimei to become Wu Zetian! Here, quickly, eat a lot so you'll grow up fast!"

"Wu Zetian is fine, Empress Lü is not," Leng Qian said curtly. Empress Lü was the empress of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han Dynasty, famous for dismembering other concubines before finally killing them. By this era, her story had become part of folklore, sometimes used as a joke to scare small children.

Zhang Zhong murmured thoughtfully, "Feilong Zai Tian..."

The Ming Cult members, including Yin Susu, Ah Luo, Mei Jian, Qi Shengniang, Leng Qian, Shuobude, Zhang Zhong, and Peng Yingyu, found their wait in Dadu stretching from days into weeks, then over a month. There was no sign or news from Wei Yixiao, Fan Yao, or Tajkis.

Instead, unsettling rumors began to circulate: a faction supporting Khayishan, the deceased former Yuan Emperor and father of both Kusala and Tugh Temur, had laid siege to Shangdu. However, the attacking forces weren't from Dadu or other nearby regions; they hailed from Liaodong and Eastern Mongolia, led by Burkha Temur and Orlugh Temur. This indicated a widespread and coordinated military action, far beyond a localized skirmish.


## *Khangai Mountains, October 1328: The Dragon Flies to Karakorum*

Kusala sat facing Duwa Temür, the biological brother of Eljigidey and Esen Bukha, in Duwa Temür's large tent. Esen Bukha, who had initially approached him, was now deceased. The current Khan among the Chagatai was Eljigidey.

They had just received news of Yesun Temur's death in Shangdu. Duwa Temür's family had long been in dispute with the Ayurbarwada faction. Kusala knew for certain that Esen Bukha had initially approached him for reasons related to this. Duwa Temür's father, who was also named Duwa, was the longest-reigning Khan among the Chagatai. He had eventually agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the Yuan Dynasty and accepted the Yuan Emperor as the Great Khan of Mongolia before his death.

Unfortunately, Duwa's first son to rule as Khan after Duwa's death was actually Esen Bukha, who always sought trouble with the Yuan Dynasty. At that time, Kusala himself was also opposing his grandmother, Dagi, due to Shidibala's candidacy. Esen Bukha then considered him an appealing potential ally, and Kusala reciprocated. However, secretly, Kusala had never approved of Esen Bukha's political stance against the Yuan Dynasty.

Kusala accepted a cup of airag from Duwa Temür, who offered a faint smile. "Now, Daulat Shah and that *Khatun* have clearly enthroned Ragibagh as both Khaghan and Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. But your younger brother, Tugh Temür, has apparently also declared himself Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty in Dadu. What will *you* do?"

Kusala laughed. "He's my brother. Of course, I know him better than anyone. He's the kind of person who'd be content if you just gave him a little freedom and security. Now that he's grown, just give him a beautiful, smooth *Xiaojie* from Jiangnan, and he'll enjoy his days without a single complaint. Why would he declare himself Khaghan? Don't tell me you believe he did it himself."

Duwa Temür burst into laughter. "Your brother is certainly different from that snot-nosed Ragibagh. With Ragibagh, you just give him *Bingtang Hulu*, and he'll sit quietly. But I agree, the ones forcing him must be people like El Temür and Bayan. Regardless of who it is, the question remains the same — *what will you do*?"

"Duwa," Kusala said, offering his cup of airag for a toast. "One thing's for sure, I thoroughly dislike the 'resurrection of the dead,' especially if those rising are people like my grandmother Dagi and my father-in-law, Temuder. They're clearly trying to use the bodies of Babukhan Khatun and Daulat Shah to rise from their graves and sow chaos in the world. If we appear in Karakorum, along with Eljigidey's forces, inviting the other Khans of the steppes to think alike, I wonder what those people in Shangdu can do?"

"And what about those in Dadu?" Duwa Temür asked, returning Kusala's toast. "What about your brother?"

Kusala's eyes flickered, then he played his card well. "I, Kusala, am fundamentally just an outcast since I caused trouble in Shaanxi. If Esen Bukha hadn't taken me in back then, I would have been forced to become a vagrant in the Gobi Desert. Their forces are your forces, but make sure you don't bother my brother," he winked. "Let him enjoy his days with some Chagatai Xiaojie as well. As for those other people, I'll pretend I don't know what you'll do later."

Internally, he thought: after this, Duwa Temür would surely want to get rid of Eljigidey, then elevate himself as Khan of the Chagatai. If, at that point, Duwa Temür also wished to become the Great Khan, then Kusala would surely eliminate him, after he had finished off Bayan and El Temür using the Chagatai military. He judged that Eljigidey was just like Esen Bukha, and so was Duwa Temür. But for now, he still needed their support.

He actually didn't mind if his younger brother truly wanted to be emperor. But because of his brother's weak personality, he would undoubtedly become a pawn of El Temür and Bayan, and that was something Kusala absolutely disliked.
