# Prologue

Current Position: Ki Son-yeo is 5 years old, learning Wu Wei and qinggong with Duoluo Haoyu.

New Event: At age 12, she inadvertently kills two palace bodyguards to avoid being taken as a concubine by the Crown Prince of Goryeo. She flees north to Dadu, then Shangdu, and eventually meets the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao."

This means there's a 7-year time jump and a dramatic shift in her circumstances.

Here's how you could structure this next segment, following directly from the qinggong lesson:

---

**Transitioning to Ki Son-yeo's Flight:**
(Following the qinggong lesson...)

"Over the next seven years, Ki Son-yeo's world expanded and deepened under Duoluo Haoyu's patient tutelage. She learned the fluidity of qinggong, the subtle power of Wu Wei, and the profound wisdom hidden in the ordinary world around her. She grew from a giggling five-year-old into a quick-witted, agile twelve-year-old, with a mind as sharp as any scholar's and a spirit as free as the river's current. Her bond with her master deepened with each passing season, his lessons shaping not just her martial skills but her very spirit.

Then, just as she was blossoming into a young woman, the gentle flow of her life in Haengju was violently disrupted. Master Duoluo, her beloved teacher, finally succumbed to his old age, leaving her without his guiding presence. It was barely a month later, while she was still reeling from the loss, that her world truly shattered."

**Then, the Inciting Incident:**
This will be a critical scene to write, showing her desperation and the raw application of her nascent skills.

*Key elements to include in that scene:*

- **The Crown Prince's Entitlement**: Clearly show the oppressive nature of his demand to take her as a concubine.
- **Ki Son-yeo's Desperation**: Emphasize her fear and panic at being alone and facing this threat without her master.
- **The "Inadvertent" Kills**: Portray how her actions, driven by pure self-preservation and perhaps an untrained application of the Wu Wei principles (using their momentum against them, or subtle evasions leading to their downfall), result in the guards' deaths. This highlights her youth and lack of malicious intent.
- The Escape: Describe her immediate, terrified flight northward. Emphasize the harshness of the journey, alone and driven by fear, as she makes her way towards Dadu and Shangdu.

**Connecting to the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao":**

- Once she reaches Dadu/Shangdu, describe her vulnerability and exhaustion before she encounters the group.
- Tajkis, Fan Yao, Yang Xiao, Yin Susu, and the other two girls: This is where you'll introduce their meeting. You have creative freedom to define their dynamic and how they came to be known as the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao," diverging from Jin Yong's original Ming Cult structure. This offers exciting possibilities for unique interactions and backstories within this new group.

This revised approach ensures Duoluo Haoyu's death adds to the pathos and heightens the stakes for Ki Son-yeo's dramatic escape and subsequent journey.

In 1314 King Chungseon passed the throne to his son King Chungsuk. In 1321 King Chungsuk fathered his son King Chunghye. This prompted the previous crown prince of Goryeo, Öljeyitü, to establish an alliance with Emperor Sidibala, and King Chungsuk was thus interned in 1321. However, Sidibala was assassinated in 1323 and Öljeitü's plan was aborted.

King Chungsuk, who was allowed to return to Goryeo in 1325, passed the throne to King Chunghye in 1330 but was reinstated after two years because King Chunghye was deposed by Yuan dynasty. Letters uncovered from the Vatican potentially suggest that the first contacts between the Vatican and Korea began during Chungsuk's reign, 261 years before Spanish Catholic priest Gregorio de Céspedes visited Joseon, the successor state of Goryeo, though some Korean researchers believe the letters could potentially have been forgeries.[2][3] On December 13, 1335, after having a dream, the King changed his personal name from To (도; 燾) to Man (만; 卍).[4]

King Chungsuk died in 1339.
