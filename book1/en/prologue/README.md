# Prologue

Current Position: Ki Son-yeo is 5 years old, learning Wu Wei and qinggong with Duoluo Haoyu.

New Event: At age 12, she inadvertently kills two palace bodyguards to avoid being taken as a concubine by the Crown Prince of Goryeo. She flees north to Dadu, then Shangdu, and eventually meets the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao."

This means there's a 7-year time jump and a dramatic shift in her circumstances.

Here's how you could structure this next segment, following directly from the qinggong lesson:

---

**Transitioning to Ki Son-yeo's Flight:**
(Following the qinggong lesson...)

"Over the next seven years, Ki Son-yeo's world expanded and deepened under Duoluo Haoyu's patient tutelage. She learned the fluidity of qinggong, the subtle power of Wu Wei, and the profound wisdom hidden in the ordinary world around her. She grew from a giggling five-year-old into a quick-witted, agile twelve-year-old, with a mind as sharp as any scholar's and a spirit as free as the river's current. Her bond with her master deepened with each passing season, his lessons shaping not just her martial skills but her very spirit.

Then, just as she was blossoming into a young woman, the gentle flow of her life in Haengju was violently disrupted. Master Duoluo, her beloved teacher, finally succumbed to his old age, leaving her without his guiding presence. It was barely a month later, while she was still reeling from the loss, that her world truly shattered."

**Then, the Inciting Incident:**
This will be a critical scene to write, showing her desperation and the raw application of her nascent skills.

*Key elements to include in that scene:*

- **The Crown Prince's Entitlement**: Clearly show the oppressive nature of his demand to take her as a concubine.
- **Ki Son-yeo's Desperation**: Emphasize her fear and panic at being alone and facing this threat without her master.
- **The "Inadvertent" Kills**: Portray how her actions, driven by pure self-preservation and perhaps an untrained application of the Wu Wei principles (using their momentum against them, or subtle evasions leading to their downfall), result in the guards' deaths. This highlights her youth and lack of malicious intent.
- The Escape: Describe her immediate, terrified flight northward. Emphasize the harshness of the journey, alone and driven by fear, as she makes her way towards Dadu and Shangdu.

**Connecting to the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao":**

- Once she reaches Dadu/Shangdu, describe her vulnerability and exhaustion before she encounters the group.
- Tajkis, Fan Yao, Yang Xiao, Yin Susu, and the other two girls: This is where you'll introduce their meeting. You have creative freedom to define their dynamic and how they came to be known as the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao," diverging from Jin Yong's original Ming Cult structure. This offers exciting possibilities for unique interactions and backstories within this new group.

This revised approach ensures Duoluo Haoyu's death adds to the pathos and heightens the stakes for Ki Son-yeo's dramatic escape and subsequent journey.

In 1314 King Chungseon passed the throne to his son King Chungsuk. In 1321 King Chungsuk fathered his son King Chunghye. This prompted the previous crown prince of Goryeo, Öljeyitü, to establish an alliance with Emperor Sidibala, and King Chungsuk was thus interned in 1321. However, Sidibala was assassinated in 1323 and Öljeitü's plan was aborted.

King Chungsuk, who was allowed to return to Goryeo in 1325, passed the throne to King Chunghye in 1330 but was reinstated after two years because King Chunghye was deposed by Yuan dynasty. Letters uncovered from the Vatican potentially suggest that the first contacts between the Vatican and Korea began during Chungsuk's reign, 261 years before Spanish Catholic priest Gregorio de Céspedes visited Joseon, the successor state of Goryeo, though some Korean researchers believe the letters could potentially have been forgeries.[2][3] On December 13, 1335, after having a dream, the King changed his personal name from To (도; 燾) to Man (만; 卍).[4]

King Chungsuk died in 1339.

Here's the historical facts found after this:

- 4 October 1323, Yesün Temür, cousin of Gegeen Khan, becomes emperor of the Yuan dynasty.
- The Comprehensive Institutions of the Great Yuan is promulgated, consisting of 2,400 legal documents divided into 4 categories

*Then our narrative should be:*

Beberapa bulan kemudian, Ki Son-yeo berhasil mencuri belati milik Ki Yun, yang sangat tajam dan terlihat indah di matanya. Ia selalu membawa-bawa belati itu di saku dalam bajunya, diam-diam ia melatih *Yue Nu Jian Fa* ajaran gurunya dengan menggunakan belati ini setiap malam, tanpa setahu orang lain. Tetapi hal semacam ini tentu saja tidak dapat disembunyikannya di hadapan Duoluo Haoyu, yang selalu mengamatinya dari jarak dekat.

Sementara itu, berita tentang penobatan Yesun Temur menjadi Khan dan Kaisar Dinasti Yuan untuk menggantikan Shidibala telah sampai di telinga Douluo Haoyu dan anaknya. Mereka membicarakannya setiap malam. Satu hal yang paling menarik bagi mereka adalah, Yesun Temur sudah dikenal sebagai Khan yang sangat mencintai tradisi asli Mongolia, *bertentangan dengan pandangan Kubilai maupun Khayishan dan Ayurbarwada*. Jelas berbeda dengan Shidibala.

Ayah Yesun Temur adalah Gammala, putra tertua Zhenjin, yang adalah pewaris resmi — putra mahkota pilihan Kubilai Khan, yang sayangnya meninggal sebelum Kubilai sendiri. Zhenjin dikenal sebagai penganut setia Konfusianisme dan jelas beraliran sama seperti Kubilai, bahkan mungkin lebih dalam. Setelah Zhenjin sendiri meninggal, Gammala ditunjuk sebagai *Jinong*[^jinong], tetapi kemudian kalah bersaing dengan adiknya, Temur. Berikutnya, Darmabala dan semua keturunan Kubilai dari sisi ini mendominasi pemilihan Khan maupun Kaisar Dinasti Yuan, membuat Gammala dan putranya, Yesun Temur, tersingkir sama sekali dari persaingan. Tetapi, sebagai Jinong, Gammala memerintah di padang rumput Mongolia dan Gurun Gobi, lalu mengabadikan keagungan Genghis Khan di sana melalui Empat Ordo Agung Mongolia. Setelah Gammala meninggal, Yesun Temur mengambil alih posisinya sebagai Jinong. Selama pemerintahan Khayishan, Ayurbarwada dan Shidibala, Yesun Temur, yang punya tanah sangat luas di utara dan pasukan militer yang kuat, menjadi pangeran yang paling dihormati oleh Majelis Agung Mongolia. Kekuatannya sebagai pemimpin di padang rumput adalah tak tertandingi oleh Khan lain.

[^jinong]: Jinong aa Jinwang (晉王) adalah yang sangat tinggi, yang bisa dijabat oleh seorang bangsawan Dinasti Yuan. Pemegang gelar ini hanya mereka yang punya ikatan keluarga dengan Kubilai.

"Hm, bagaimana reaksi rakyat Zhongyuan?" tanya Douluo Haoyu, memejamkan mata di atas dipannya, "Mereka menyukai Yesun Temur ini?"

"Oh, ini sangat menarik," kata Douluo Jing, tertawa, "Mula-mula banyak orang ragu-ragu, karena pandangan Yesun Temur jelas berbau busuk — sangat fanatik pada cara-cara tradisional Mongolia. Tapi ternyata, sejak awal penobatannya, dia menunjukkan penghargaan kepada semua pejabat suku Han, dan yang menganut aliran ini! Rakyat jelata kemudian terbelah dua, dan banyak yang memuji-muji dia."

Douluo Haoyu tertawa, "Jelas, karena dia naik tahta melalui *kudeta*!"

---

*Small correction here, the surname 'Duoluo' was a typo all along, it should be "Douluo" (斗罗), and that isn't a common surname, he was invented it. He actually was a child found by Guo Jing and Huang Rong during the siege in the north, while Guo Jing still following Genghis Khan. Let's continue the narrative:*

"Menurut ayah dia ikut dalam *kudeta* berdarah itu?" tanya Douluo Jing.

"Itu sudah pasti," jawab ayahnya, "Kau tadi bilang, siapa — nama pejabatnya itu?"

"Daulat Syah," jawab Douluo Jing. "Dia seorang Islam."

"Oh, benar. Orang ini pasti punya hubungan dengan Walus, utusan Tegshi itu, yang katanya *datang terlambat* untuk memberitahu Shidibala," kata Douluo Haoyu, lagi-lagi tertawa, "Mana ada kejadian seperti itu? Membohongi anak kacil!"

"Nah, ayah keliru," kata Douluo Jing lagi, "Sekarang, ternyata Tegshi, Esen Temur dan yang lain itu dihukm mati — semuanya! Yesun Temur, mengirim pasukan ke Dadu dan Shangdu, untuk menangkap para pejabat yang dianggapnya cenderung memberontak terhadap Shidibala."

"Itu karena dia takut berikutnya orang-orang itu akan membuatnya menjadi 'Kaisar Boneka'!" kata ayahnya. "Nah, sekarang katakan, Daulat Syah itu sekarang diangkat menjadi apa?"

In 1323 when Shidebala Gegeen Khan (Emperor Yingzong) was assassinated by Grand Censor Tegshi and Esen Temur, the rebellious group welcomed Yesün Temür since his mother was Buyan Kelmish of the Khunggirad clan. According to the official history of the Yuan, Yesün Temür caused Tegshi's envoy Walus to be seized and sent notice of the plot to Shidibala Khan, but the messengers arrived too late.[4]

Yesün Temür was not merely the principal beneficiary of the conspiracy but was also very likely a participant.[2] It is said that his administrator Dawlat Shah had established close contact with the conspirators. After receiving the imperial seal sent by the conspirators, he ascended to the throne on the bank of the Kherlen River in Mongolia on October 4, 1323. Esen Temur was made the grand councilor of the right, and Tegshi the manager of the Bureau of Military Affairs. Upon learning that he would incur suspicion as a party to the murders, he suddenly reversed his policy and ordered Tegshi, Esen Temur, and others to be put to death. Under the leadership of Chang Kuei, the late Khagan's officials sent a letter to Yesün Temür urging him to accept the throne and to punish the conspirators.[5] He sent troops to Dadu and Shangdu and had rebellious officers executed before he entered Dadu because he feared becoming their puppet. The five princes who had been involved were exiled to Yunnan, Hainan, and other distant places.

Chinese officials repeatedly urged Yesün Temür to extend the purge to all former allies of Temuder and Tegshi and their families, but Yesün Temür Khan refused.[6] He issued an amnesty decree, and the confiscated properties of the executed conspirators were returned to their families.[7]

---

As a ruler who had seized the throne by intrigue and violence, Yesün Temür tried to win the widest possible support. To secure support as Emperor of China from the Han populace, he duly showed his respect for the Confucian tradition from the beginning of his reign.[9] Nevertheless, Muslim and Mongol officials from the steppe constituted the majority of posts in the Yuan government during this period. Kumeijil and Tas Temur served as grand councillars of the right; Dawlat Shah served as the manager of the governmental affairs of the Central Secretariat (中書省), then as censor in chief, and finally as grand councillary of the left; and Andachu, the manager of the Bureau of Military Affairs.[10]

In addition to Dawlat Shah, there were two Muslims, Ubaidullah and Bayanchar, who served as managers of governmental affairs in the Secretariat. Mahmud Shah and Hasan Khoja managed the Bureau of Military Affairs. In contrast with the Muslims, Han officials exerted little influence on the administration. The high point of the Mongol partner-merchants' operations came under Yesün Temür, whose administration exempted Christians and Muslims from any corvee payments and guaranteed huge payments promised by the Mongolian nobility in return for luxury goods (тансаг).[11]

**Feilong Zai Tian 飛龍在天**

Xiang Long Shiba Zhang (降龍十八掌):

The famous and fearsomely powerful martial art of the Beggars Clan. It was created by the book, I Ching. The second stroke in the 18 Dragon-Subduing Palms (飛龍在天) is based on the Chinese adage that a dragon in the sky will be able to spot men of greatness below it. This suggests that the dragon, from its elevated position, will have an overview on the affairs of the world hence being able to keep track of mortal ongoing and spot men of great deeds and virtue.
