## *Dadu, 1326: The Leopards of Ulug Ulus*

In Dadu, Yesün Temür gazed at a group of large, magnificent leopards sent to him from Ulug Ulus, laughing heartily. He turned to Daulat Shah, "Look at these gifts from Ozbeg. What do you all think they mean?"

Daulat Shah, suppressing a shiver at the sight of the leopards' fangs, grinned widely. "Surely, it means they fear Huang Shang."

Nearby, Ubaidullah and Bayanchar, who had come into good fortune after Sidibala's death and were now seated in the Zhongshu Sheng, grimaced, trying to hold back gasps as the leopards bared their teeth before their faces.

"So," Yesün Temür continued, though he knew what the three sycophants before him would answer, "how do you think we should repay their kindness?"

Shrugging, while glancing at Bayanchar and Daulat Shah, Ubaidullah casually remarked, "Just give them a little money, gold, and silver. They'll obey all of Huang Shang's subsequent commands."

Tossing a lump of meat into the cage of one of his new leopards, Yesün Temür smiled faintly. "Ubaidullah, if you eat too much sugar, your mouth will certainly be sweet, but for others, it's rather bothersome — it *stinks*!" He extended another lump of meat towards Bayanchar. "Give this to my good friends here." He then turned to Daulat Shah, "That's fine, but only half the amount you're thinking of."

He knew there was a bad habit of wasteful spending within his ranks at the moment, buying expensive stones imported by foreign merchants and sold here at ten times their original price. He also knew perfectly well that many poor people were starving in the southern regions. He deeply detested such practices.

Hearing the decision, Daulat Shah, Ubaidullah, and Bayanchar immediately bowed respectfully, assenting, and prepared to leave. But Yesün Temür raised his hand. "Hey, one more thing. From now on, don't buy those extremely expensive stones anymore! And I also officially forbid Lamas (Tibetan monks) from entering here starting now. Prepare an official announcement for this. They only add to the chaos and damage the reputation of the Yuan Dynasty!"
