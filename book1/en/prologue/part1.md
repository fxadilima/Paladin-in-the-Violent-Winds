# Prologue
## *Haengju, 1320: The Smart Little Fairy*

One afternoon in Haengju, a city in southern Goryeo, a girl of about five was listening intently to her teacher's story. Her eyes barely blinked. Occasionally, she'd ask questions with eager curiosity in Han Chinese that sounded almost indistinguishable from the dialect of Jiangnan residents. She was called Ki Son-yeo[^ki-sonyeo], but her teacher had given her a unique and beautiful name, 'Qi Shengniang'[^shengniang], using her own surname 'Ki' (pronounced in Han Chinese), and adding a name meaning 'Holy Maiden.'

[^shengniang]: Sheng Niang (聖娘), 'Holy Maiden'.
[^ki-sonyeo]: Her surname is Ki '기'. The two characters Son-yeo (소녀) simply mean 'girl' and would also be translated as 'Niang' (娘) in Han Chinese.

Her martial arts teacher, Duoluo Haoyu, was a man of about ninety, a former member of the Beggars' Sect (Kai Pang) who had eventually come to Goryeo and settled in Haengju. Duoluo Haoyu married a Goryeo woman, and his daughter now had a son and two daughters. His three grandchildren were roughly the same age as this cherished, sole female disciple. In Haengju, he had originally worked only as a farmer, but eventually, a nobleman named Ki Ja-oh discovered that Duoluo Haoyu was a high-level martial arts expert. At the time, Ki Ja-oh had no idea that Duoluo Haoyu had previously been an eight-pouch elder of the Beggars' Sect.

Haoyu himself was quite elderly at the time, and he happened to be passing through a bustling market. A royal officer was arguing with a female shop owner because the officer refused to pay for the food he had eaten, claiming the shop was overcharging.

From a distance, Duoluo Haoyu watched the commotion. Like everyone else, he didn't feel the price set by the shop owner was excessive. The officer then intended to leave quickly after smashing a table to show off his strength as a man and intimidate the shop owner. No one dared to defend the woman, and Haoyu couldn't restrain himself. He secretly placed his wooden staff near the foot of the enraged, wide-striding officer. The officer stumbled but didn't fall. He glared at everyone around him, barking, "Who tripped me?"

One man standing near Haoyu certainly saw the act but deliberately didn't say anything. At that moment, Haoyu himself had quickly moved several steps from his original position without being clearly seen by the officer.

This afternoon, when Doulou Jing, the son of Duoluo Houyu, recounted the story of his father, Ki Son-yeo giggled. "Didn't Shifu get caught at that time?"

Duoluo Jing said, "Do you want *Shishu*'s father to get caught or not?"

"Of course not!" Ki Son-yeo said, grinning widely, showing his neat, white teeth. He turned to his teacher, "Shifu, Shengniang wants to see how Shifu blocks that person's feet!"

Duoluo Haoyu, smiling faintly, said, "Ah Jing, try demonstrating."

Ki Son-yeo then walked to the right, passing by Duoluo Jing, who was also considered her martial uncle. Suddenly his uncle's right leg appeared in front of her walking foot. Of course, the girl immediately fell. Her uncle quickly caught her, preventing her from falling to the floor. But she protested, "This method is difficult! Shengniang can't do it, it takes a lot of strength!"

Duoluo Haoyu's old eyes lit up, as he said, "Shengniang, you are too fixated on *ways*. Actually, Shifu doesn't do it that way either. There are many *ways* to do things, the most correct is *Wu Wei*[^wu-wei]."

Ki Son-yeo looked at his master curiously. "Wu Wei?" paused, then asked, "Shifu, *dizi"[^dizi] doesn't understand."

[wu-wei]: Wu Wei (無為), this can be translated as "effortless".
[^dizi]: Dizi (弟子), "Disciple". This is how a disciple addresses himself in front of his master.


"Now, you see, Shifu is old now," Duoluo Haoyu said, laughing. "Your uncle, of course, is much stronger. How could Shifu trip him?"

Duoluo Jing smiled faintly. He knew what his father meant, but not yet how his father would demonstrate it. Suddenly, his father stood up, approached him abruptly, and exclaimed, "Hey!" extending his right hand towards Duoluo Jing's face, palm open. Startled, Duoluo Jing instinctively stepped his right foot back. But then he immediately fell. The next second, he realized the move was just a feint. His father had actually placed his staff with his left hand behind Duoluo Jing's leg. He fell because he hadn't anticipated this.

He laughed as he got up, looking at Ki Son-yeo who was giggling. "Father cheated!"

Duoluo Haoyu looked surprised. "Did I push you just now? You fell on your own." He turned to his young disciple, winking, "Now — that's Wu Wei. So it's not entirely doing nothing."

He led them to the front yard of his house, where a small, clear river flowed westward. In the middle of this little river was a large rock that seemed to impede the not-too-swift current. Duoluo Haoyu usually taught Ki Son-yeo atop this large rock.

"Look at the water, what do you see?" he said, taking Ki Son-yeo's hand and lightly guiding her onto the rock where they usually practiced kung fu. From atop the rock, they could see the river's flow from every direction. Duoluo Jing followed his father, leaping lightly.

Ki Son-yeo giggled and said, "Water, of course."

But Duoluo Haoyu wouldn't give up. "Can you see its shape?"

Ki Son-yeo now looked confused. "Shifu, water has no shape."

Now Duoluo Jing laughed. Since childhood, he had often heard this question from his father. He picked up a large, hollow piece of bamboo, which Ki Son-yeo usually used for drinking. He filled it with river water and said, "See, now the water becomes bamboo."

"Oh!" Ki Son-yeo exclaimed, her eyes instantly sparkling as she clapped her hands happily. "So water actually has many shapes. Water can change!"

"And what else do you see?" her teacher asked.

Ki Son-yeo remembered her teacher's story about the great flood that devastated Zhongyuan due to the overflowing Yellow River. She eagerly said, "Shifu, water can even collapse large buildings and kill many people!"

Her teacher and Duoluo Jing laughed. "That's true," Duoluo Jing said, "But you can't judge water as bad just because people drown or there are floods. Can you imagine if there were no water? We couldn't drink, all our plants would die."

"Now, try to see how the water flows," Duoluo Haoyu said, pointing eastward. "This water comes from the east, which is higher ground. We're standing on this large rock, but the water keeps flowing. Of course, it would overflow if more places were covered. But water will find its own way, through the gaps in the rocks, until it reaches its original destination."

"Ah! So that's what Shifu means, there are many ways to do everything," Ki Son-yeo said, her eyes sparkling. "Like this water, it can go around the rock, it can seep through the ground, it can go over it if there's a flood!"

"Exactly," Duoluo Haoyu said. "Are you afraid you can't do something that requires great strength? But ants can make a person run without effort." He carried the child to leap across the river, where many mulberry trees stood. Many fallen fruits invited ants to come. "Look, they gather there easily. What do you see here?"

This time, Ki Son-yeo immediately cheered, "Of course they come, because what fell is sweet! Ants like sweet things!"

Her words this time made Duoluo Jing murmur, "So, if we want to invite ants, just give them sugar... Hmm..." He then asked Ki Son-yeo, "What do you think we should do if we want to invite people?"

Ki Son-yeo grinned widely, saying, "Father says people like money the most, so just give them money."

Duoluo Haoyu's eyes twinkled. He scooped water from the riverbank using the bamboo his son had brought, saying as he walked back, "You can indeed invite ants to scare people. They'll come if there's sugar. But..." He poured water from the bamboo over a mulberry fruit swarming with ants, "if that 'sugar' isn't there, the ants will leave. And what if the person you're trying to scare turns against you?"

Ki Son-yeo was actually thinking about how to scare a boy her age, whom she didn't know but who often seemed to come with other guests to see her father. For some inexplicable reason, the boy often approached her, and she didn't like it. She was thinking of smearing lots of sugar on his clothes if he dared come near. Now, after her teacher doused the ants, she felt this idea wasn't so good. She mumbled, "So, before scaring someone, we need to learn how to run away first..."

Her teacher smiled, took her hand, and said, "Yes, that's right. Before you learn to use a sword, first learn what *qinggong* is." Ki Son-yeo then felt her body float as her teacher lightly leaped back onto the large rock where they usually practiced kung fu.

Current Position: Ki Son-yeo is 5 years old, learning Wu Wei and qinggong with Duoluo Haoyu.

New Event: At age 12, she inadvertently kills two palace bodyguards to avoid being taken as a concubine by the Crown Prince of Goryeo. She flees north to Dadu, then Shangdu, and eventually meets the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao."

This means there's a 7-year time jump and a dramatic shift in her circumstances.

Here's how you could structure this next segment, following directly from the qinggong lesson:

---

**Transitioning to Ki Son-yeo's Flight:**
(Following the qinggong lesson...)

"Over the next seven years, Ki Son-yeo's world expanded and deepened under Duoluo Haoyu's patient tutelage. She learned the fluidity of qinggong, the subtle power of Wu Wei, and the profound wisdom hidden in the ordinary world around her. She grew from a giggling five-year-old into a quick-witted, agile twelve-year-old, with a mind as sharp as any scholar's and a spirit as free as the river's current. Her bond with her master deepened with each passing season, his lessons shaping not just her martial skills but her very spirit.

Then, just as she was blossoming into a young woman, the gentle flow of her life in Haengju was violently disrupted. Master Duoluo, her beloved teacher, finally succumbed to his old age, leaving her without his guiding presence. It was barely a month later, while she was still reeling from the loss, that her world truly shattered."

**Then, the Inciting Incident:**
This will be a critical scene to write, showing her desperation and the raw application of her nascent skills.

*Key elements to include in that scene:*

- **The Crown Prince's Entitlement**: Clearly show the oppressive nature of his demand to take her as a concubine.
- **Ki Son-yeo's Desperation**: Emphasize her fear and panic at being alone and facing this threat without her master.
- **The "Inadvertent" Kills**: Portray how her actions, driven by pure self-preservation and perhaps an untrained application of the Wu Wei principles (using their momentum against them, or subtle evasions leading to their downfall), result in the guards' deaths. This highlights her youth and lack of malicious intent.
- The Escape: Describe her immediate, terrified flight northward. Emphasize the harshness of the journey, alone and driven by fear, as she makes her way towards Dadu and Shangdu.

**Connecting to the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao":**

- Once she reaches Dadu/Shangdu, describe her vulnerability and exhaustion before she encounters the group.
- Tajkis, Fan Yao, Yang Xiao, Yin Susu, and the other two girls: This is where you'll introduce their meeting. You have creative freedom to define their dynamic and how they came to be known as the "7 Heroes of Ming Jiao," diverging from Jin Yong's original Ming Cult structure. This offers exciting possibilities for unique interactions and backstories within this new group.

This revised approach ensures Duoluo Haoyu's death adds to the pathos and heightens the stakes for Ki Son-yeo's dramatic escape and subsequent journey.
