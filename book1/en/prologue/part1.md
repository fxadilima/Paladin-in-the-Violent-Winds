## *Haengju, 1320: The Smart Little Fairy

One afternoon in Haengju, a city in southern Goryeo, a girl of about five was listening intently to her teacher's story. Her eyes barely blinked. Occasionally, she'd ask questions with eager curiosity in Han Chinese that sounded almost indistinguishable from the dialect of Jiangnan residents. She was called Ki Son-yeo[^ki-sonyeo], but her teacher had given her a unique and beautiful name, 'Qi Shengniang'[^shengniang], using her own surname 'Ki' (pronounced in Han Chinese), and adding a name meaning 'Holy Maiden.'

[^shengniang]: Sheng Niang (聖娘), 'Holy Maiden'.
[^ki-sonyeo]: Her surname is Ki '기'. The two characters Son-yeo (소녀) simply mean 'girl' and would also be translated as 'Niang' (娘) in Han Chinese.

Her martial arts teacher, Duoluo Haoyu, was a man of about ninety, a former member of the Beggars' Sect (Kai Pang) who had eventually come to Goryeo and settled in Haengju. Duoluo Haoyu married a Goryeo woman, and his daughter now had a son and two daughters. His three grandchildren were roughly the same age as this cherished, sole female disciple. In Haengju, he had originally worked only as a farmer, but eventually, a nobleman named Ki Ja-oh discovered that Duoluo Haoyu was a high-level martial arts expert. At the time, Ki Ja-oh had no idea that Duoluo Haoyu had previously been an eight-pouch elder of the Beggars' Sect.

Haoyu himself was quite elderly at the time, and he happened to be passing through a bustling market. A royal officer was arguing with a female shop owner because the officer refused to pay for the food he had eaten, claiming the shop was overcharging.

From a distance, Duoluo Haoyu watched the commotion. Like everyone else, he didn't feel the price set by the shop owner was excessive. The officer then intended to leave quickly after smashing a table to show off his strength as a man and intimidate the shop owner. No one dared to defend the woman, and Haoyu couldn't restrain himself. He secretly placed his wooden staff near the foot of the enraged, wide-striding officer. The officer stumbled but didn't fall. He glared at everyone around him, barking, "Who tripped me?"

One man standing near Haoyu certainly saw the act but deliberately didn't say anything. At that moment, Haoyu himself had quickly moved several steps from his original position without being clearly seen by the officer.

This afternoon, when Doulou Jing, the son of Duoluo Houyu, recounted the story of his father, Ki Son-yeo giggled. "Didn't Shifu get caught at that time?"

Duoluo Jing said, "Do you want *Shishu*'s father to get caught or not?"

"Of course not!" Ki Son-yeo said, grinning widely, showing his neat, white teeth. He turned to his teacher, "Shifu, Shengniang wants to see how Shifu blocks that person's feet!"

Duoluo Haoyu, smiling faintly, said, "Ah Jing, try demonstrating."

Ki Son-yeo then walked to the right, passing by Duoluo Jing, who was also considered her martial uncle. Suddenly his uncle's right leg appeared in front of her walking foot. Of course, the girl immediately fell. Her uncle quickly caught her, preventing her from falling to the floor. But she protested, "This method is difficult! Shengniang can't do it, it takes a lot of strength!"

Duoluo Haoyu's old eyes lit up, as he said, "Shengniang, you are too fixated on *ways*. Actually, Shifu doesn't do it that way either. There are many *ways* to do things, the most correct is *Wu Wei*[^wu-wei]."

Ki Son-yeo looked at his master curiously. "Wu Wei?" paused, then asked, "Shifu, *dizi"[^dizi] doesn't understand."

[wu-wei]: Wu Wei (無為), this can be translated as "effortless".
[^dizi]: Dizi (弟子), "Disciple". This is how a disciple addresses himself in front of his master.


"Now, you see, Shifu is old now," Duoluo Haoyu said, laughing. "Your uncle, of course, is much stronger. How could Shifu trip him?"

Duoluo Jing smiled faintly. He knew what his father meant, but not yet how his father would demonstrate it. Suddenly, his father stood up, approached him abruptly, and exclaimed, "Hey!" extending his right hand towards Duoluo Jing's face, palm open. Startled, Duoluo Jing instinctively stepped his right foot back. But then he immediately fell. The next second, he realized the move was just a feint. His father had actually placed his staff with his left hand behind Duoluo Jing's leg. He fell because he hadn't anticipated this.

He laughed as he got up, looking at Ki Son-yeo who was giggling. "Father cheated!"

Duoluo Haoyu looked surprised. "Did I push you just now? You fell on your own." He turned to his young disciple, winking, "Now — that's Wu Wei. So it's not entirely doing nothing."

He led them to the front yard of his house, where a small, clear river flowed westward. In the middle of this little river was a large rock that seemed to impede the not-too-swift current. Duoluo Haoyu usually taught Ki Son-yeo atop this large rock.

"Look at the water, what do you see?" he said, taking Ki Son-yeo's hand and lightly guiding her onto the rock where they usually practiced kung fu. From atop the rock, they could see the river's flow from every direction. Duoluo Jing followed his father, leaping lightly.
