# Prologue
## *Haengju, 1320: The Smart Little Fairy*

One afternoon in Haengju, a city in southern Goryeo, a girl of about five was listening intently to her teacher's story. Her eyes barely blinked. Occasionally, she'd ask questions with eager curiosity in Han Chinese that sounded almost indistinguishable from the dialect of Jiangnan residents. She was called Ki Son-yeo[^ki-sonyeo], but her teacher had given her a unique and beautiful name, 'Qi Shengniang'[^shengniang], using her own surname 'Ki' (pronounced in Han Chinese), and adding a name meaning 'Holy Maiden.'

[^shengniang]: Sheng Niang (聖娘), 'Holy Maiden'.
[^ki-sonyeo]: Her surname is Ki '기'. The two characters Son-yeo (소녀) simply mean 'girl' and would also be translated as 'Niang' (娘) in Han Chinese.

Her martial arts teacher, Duoluo Haoyu, was a man of about ninety, a former member of the Beggars' Sect (Kai Pang) who had eventually come to Goryeo and settled in Haengju. Duoluo Haoyu married a Goryeo woman, and his daughter now had a son and two daughters. His three grandchildren were roughly the same age as this cherished, sole female disciple. In Haengju, he had originally worked only as a farmer, but eventually, a nobleman named Ki Ja-oh discovered that Duoluo Haoyu was a high-level martial arts expert. At the time, Ki Ja-oh had no idea that Duoluo Haoyu had previously been an eight-pouch elder of the Beggars' Sect.

Haoyu himself was quite elderly at the time, and he happened to be passing through a bustling market. A royal officer was arguing with a female shop owner because the officer refused to pay for the food he had eaten, claiming the shop was overcharging.

From a distance, Duoluo Haoyu watched the commotion. Like everyone else, he didn't feel the price set by the shop owner was excessive. The officer then intended to leave quickly after smashing a table to show off his strength as a man and intimidate the shop owner. No one dared to defend the woman, and Haoyu couldn't restrain himself. He secretly placed his wooden staff near the foot of the enraged, wide-striding officer. The officer stumbled but didn't fall. He glared at everyone around him, barking, "Who tripped me?"

One man standing near Haoyu certainly saw the act but deliberately didn't say anything. At that moment, Haoyu himself had quickly moved several steps from his original position without being clearly seen by the officer.

This afternoon, when Doulou Jing, the son of Duoluo Houyu, recounted the story of his father, Ki Son-yeo giggled. "Didn't Shifu get caught at that time?"

Duoluo Jing said, "Do you want *Shishu*'s father to get caught or not?"

"Of course not!" Ki Son-yeo said, grinning widely, showing his neat, white teeth. He turned to his teacher, "Shifu, Shengniang wants to see how Shifu blocks that person's feet!"

Duoluo Haoyu, smiling faintly, said, "Ah Jing, try demonstrating."

Ki Son-yeo then walked to the right, passing by Duoluo Jing, who was also considered her martial uncle. Suddenly his uncle's right leg appeared in front of her walking foot. Of course, the girl immediately fell. Her uncle quickly caught her, preventing her from falling to the floor. But she protested, "This method is difficult! Shengniang can't do it, it takes a lot of strength!"

Duoluo Haoyu's old eyes lit up, as he said, "Shengniang, you are too fixated on *ways*. Actually, Shifu doesn't do it that way either. There are many *ways* to do things, the most correct is *Wu Wei*[^wu-wei]."

Ki Son-yeo looked at his master curiously. "Wu Wei?" paused, then asked, "Shifu, *dizi"[^dizi] doesn't understand."

[wu-wei]: Wu Wei (無為), this can be translated as "effortless".
[^dizi]: Dizi (弟子), "Disciple". This is how a disciple addresses himself in front of his master.

"Now, you see, Shifu is old now," Duoluo Haoyu said, laughing. "Your uncle, of course, is much stronger. How could Shifu trip him?"

Duoluo Jing smiled faintly. He knew what his father meant, but not yet how his father would demonstrate it. Suddenly, his father stood up, approached him abruptly, and exclaimed, "Hey!" extending his right hand towards Duoluo Jing's face, palm open. Startled, Duoluo Jing instinctively stepped his right foot back. But then he immediately fell. The next second, he realized the move was just a feint. His father had actually placed his staff with his left hand behind Duoluo Jing's leg. He fell because he hadn't anticipated this.

He laughed as he got up, looking at Ki Son-yeo who was giggling. "Father cheated!"

Duoluo Haoyu looked surprised. "Did I push you just now? You fell on your own." He turned to his young disciple, winking, "Now — that's Wu Wei. So it's not entirely doing nothing."

He led them to the front yard of his house, where a small, clear river flowed westward. In the middle of this little river was a large rock that seemed to impede the not-too-swift current. Duoluo Haoyu usually taught Ki Son-yeo atop this large rock.

"Look at the water, what do you see?" he said, taking Ki Son-yeo's hand and lightly guiding her onto the rock where they usually practiced kung fu. From atop the rock, they could see the river's flow from every direction. Duoluo Jing followed his father, leaping lightly.

Ki Son-yeo giggled and said, "Water, of course."

But Duoluo Haoyu wouldn't give up. "Can you see its shape?"

Ki Son-yeo now looked confused. "Shifu, water has no shape."

Now Duoluo Jing laughed. Since childhood, he had often heard this question from his father. He picked up a large, hollow piece of bamboo, which Ki Son-yeo usually used for drinking. He filled it with river water and said, "See, now the water becomes bamboo."

"Oh!" Ki Son-yeo exclaimed, her eyes instantly sparkling as she clapped her hands happily. "So water actually has many shapes. Water can change!"

"And what else do you see?" her teacher asked.

Ki Son-yeo remembered her teacher's story about the great flood that devastated Zhongyuan due to the overflowing Yellow River. She eagerly said, "Shifu, water can even collapse large buildings and kill many people!"

Her teacher and Duoluo Jing laughed. "That's true," Duoluo Jing said, "But you can't judge water as bad just because people drown or there are floods. Can you imagine if there were no water? We couldn't drink, all our plants would die."

"Now, try to see how the water flows," Duoluo Haoyu said, pointing eastward. "This water comes from the east, which is higher ground. We're standing on this large rock, but the water keeps flowing. Of course, it would overflow if more places were covered. But water will find its own way, through the gaps in the rocks, until it reaches its original destination."

"Ah! So that's what Shifu means, there are many ways to do everything," Ki Son-yeo said, her eyes sparkling. "Like this water, it can go around the rock, it can seep through the ground, it can go over it if there's a flood!"

"Exactly," Duoluo Haoyu said. "Are you afraid you can't do something that requires great strength? But ants can make a person run without effort." He carried the child to leap across the river, where many mulberry trees stood. Many fallen fruits invited ants to come. "Look, they gather there easily. What do you see here?"

This time, Ki Son-yeo immediately cheered, "Of course they come, because what fell is sweet! Ants like sweet things!"

Her words this time made Duoluo Jing murmur, "So, if we want to invite ants, just give them sugar... Hmm..." He then asked Ki Son-yeo, "What do you think we should do if we want to invite people?"

Ki Son-yeo grinned widely, saying, "Father says people like money the most, so just give them money."

Duoluo Haoyu's eyes twinkled. He scooped water from the riverbank using the bamboo his son had brought, saying as he walked back, "You can indeed invite ants to scare people. They'll come if there's sugar. But..." He poured water from the bamboo over a mulberry fruit swarming with ants, "if that 'sugar' isn't there, the ants will leave. And what if the person you're trying to scare turns against you?"

Ki Son-yeo was actually thinking about how to scare a boy her age, whom she didn't know but who often seemed to come with other guests to see her father. For some inexplicable reason, the boy often approached her, and she didn't like it. She was thinking of smearing lots of sugar on his clothes if he dared come near. Now, after her teacher doused the ants, she felt this idea wasn't so good. She mumbled, "So, before scaring someone, we need to learn how to run away first..."

Her teacher smiled, took her hand, and said, "Yes, that's right. Before you learn to use a sword, first learn what *qinggong* is." Ki Son-yeo then felt her body float as her teacher lightly leaped back onto the large rock where they usually practiced kung fu.

After Khayishan's death, Ayurbarwada reneged on his promise, appointing his own son, Shidibala, as the Crown Prince of the Yuan Dynasty. This marked the beginning of a deep rift and contention between two major factions: his own supporters and those of his elder brother, Khayishan.

Now, on this day, Ayurbarwada himself had passed away, eliciting a myriad of reactions among both the common people and within the government.

Ayurbarwada, the second son of Darmabala and Dagi of the Khonggirad clan, was a great-grandson of Kublai Khan. He had studied under Li Meng, a Confucian scholar, which significantly influenced his political conduct from a young age. Under Khayishan's leadership, he was appointed as the Head of Zhongshu Sheng (中書省), the Central Secretariat. He was surrounded by a large number of Han bureaucrats, including Chen Hao, Wang I, Wang Yueh, Zhao Mengfu, Wang Chieh, Chan Yaoho, Shang-ye, Yao sui, and Hsia ku, as well as artists like Shang cheng and Wang Cheng-peng. He was fluent in both speaking and writing Han Chinese, complementing his deep love for Han calligraphy and painting, and his profound knowledge of Confucian teachings and Han history.

Long before his ascension to the throne, he and his elder brother, Khayishan, were sidelined from the political arena by Bulugan Khatun, the empress of Temur Khan, who acted on behalf of her ailing husband. After Temur's death, Bulugan, who was from the Bayaud clan, attempted to elevate Khayishan and Ayurbarwada's uncle, Ananda, a powerful Muslim who served as the Governor of Zhongxing. This attempt was discovered by Darkhan Harghasun, the You Chengxiang (右丞相) or Right Grand Counselor at the time. Darkhan Harghasun then summoned Ayurbarwada back to Dadu from Huaizhou. Together, they successfully orchestrated a plan to imprison Bulugan and Ananda.

In short, Khayishan subsequently ascended the throne and appointed Ayurbarwada as Crown Prince. The two brothers promised each other that their children would rule in alternating succession.

Unlike previous successions, which often led to disputes, when Khayishan died, Ayurbarwada smoothly stepped onto the throne.

The Khonggirat faction under Temuder and Dagi became even more powerful at the court. They considered Shidibala an obstacle, and wouldn't let him rule for too long.


## *Nanpo, September 4, 1323: The Reform of Confucian Emperor*

Shidibala's powerful grandmother Dagi installed Shidibala as Crown Prince in 1316, and then as Khan, since he was mothered by a Khonggirad khatun. He was made the nominal head of both the Secretariat and the Bureau of Military Affairs one year later. *Common people in Dadu saw this as a very promising new era, especially among the Han who held high hopes for his strong Confucian principles*.

At one time, his father Ayurbarwada had even toyed with the idea of abdicating the throne in favor of Shidibala. Dagi's protégé Temuder was made as tutor to the heir apparent, Shidibala, *after he failed to increase tax revenue*.

Between Ayurbarwada's death in March 1320 and his own death in October 1322, Temüder attained a great power with the full support of Dagi. Immediately after her grandson's succession, Dagi reinstated Temüder as Minister of the Secretariat and took politics into her own hands more openly than during Ayurbarwada's reign.

Despite Shidibala's aim to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, *Temuder's faction* linked up with the Alan guard and assassinated Shidibala in 1323. *This was the first violent transition struggle in the Yuan dynasty's history*, which is also known as the Coup d'état at Nanpo (南坡之變), that an emperor was overthrown by a group led by a non-Borjigin.

## *Haengju, February 1324: A Little Fairy's Understanding of Power*

When news of Shidibala's assassination reached Duoluo Haoyu's household, Ki Son-yeo, then almost nine years old, had already mastered the qinggong taught by her master, leaping onto the large rock in the middle of the river and returning without anyone's help. Her master had also begun teaching her the fundamentals of Yue Nu Jian Fa using a wooden sword.

As she sat before her master's martial uncle and Duoluo Haoyu himself, near their bamboo hut, Ki Son-yeo overheard Duoluo Jing remark, "The people's newfound hope, vanished just like that...! Truly cruel!"

Then her father responded, "They even dared to ally with the palace guards to kill the emperor; this is the beginning of a great war within Kublai Khan's own family. Since ancient times, the ambition of those around the emperor has always been the problem. Now, if they are not satisfied, they dare to kill the emperor. So, who should the people truly consider the strongest?"

Ki Son-yeo interjected with a laugh, "The strongest? Of course, Shifu!"

Her words made Duoluo Haoyu, who now often leaned on a bamboo couch, burst into laughter. "Aiyaaa, good child, you make this poor old man sound like a god. You might have kungfu as high as the heavens, but when you're old, you can only ponder everything on a couch like this with your eyes closed. Genghis Khan begged to meet Qiu Chuji, making that old man walk thousands of li, just to say the same thing — no one can live forever. People are always looking for fortune tellers to predict what will happen in the future. I find that very foolish. There is only one thing that is truly certain in this world, and they deliberately blind themselves to it, seeking things they consider magical."

Driven by curiosity, Ki Son-yeo offered her bamboo cup so Duoluo Haoyu could drink, then asked, "Shifu, what is that most certain thing?"

Old Duoluo Haoyu's eyes twinkled. "You don't know? Of course, all of us, sooner or later, will surely die. That's the only thing certain to me; beyond that, everything is uncertain."

Ki Son-yeo was silent for a moment, then became curious about another matter, "Shifu, what does that Dadu business have to do with us here?"

Duoluo Haoyu turned to his son. "Ah Jing, have you not told her who that brat is who often visits Shengniang's father's house?"

Duoluo Jing seemed hesitant, not answering immediately, creating a brief silence. The rustle of bamboo leaves in the pre-spring breeze adorned their small gathering in Duoluo Haoyu's cottage yard. The gurgle of the river current sounded like the accompanying music for a traditional Goryeo folk dance, which Ki Son-yeo's mother had recently begun teaching her.

Then, somewhat reluctantly, Duoluo Jing replied, "Shengniang, that *prince* will apparently be your husband later..."

Little Ki Son-yeo's eyebrows shot up as she sharply interjected, "Husband? Prince? What husband? A prince from where?"

Seeing her reaction, Duoluo Haoyu sighed, shook his head sadly, then lay back on the bamboo couch, closing his eyes to ponder. The prince's name was Wang Jeong, son of the King of Goryeo, Wang To, who had inherited the throne as King Chungsuk of Goryeo in 1314. He was granted the Mongolian name 'Aratnashiri'. This had prompted Goryeo's then-Crown Prince, Wang Ko, who was actually Wang To's uncle, to immediately forge an alliance with Shidibala in Dadu. In Duoluo Haoyu's eyes, the problems within the Goryeo court were as complex as those that had plagued Zhongyuan throughout history and now the Yuan Dynasty, all revolving around succession struggles. He absolutely disliked the idea of his disciple being entangled in such matters, but it seemed Ki Ja-oh had already agreed to it—after all, Wang To was their King, and a royal decree was beyond objection.

Feeling her master was ignoring her questions, Ki Son-yeo shook his shoulder, whining, almost crying. "Shifu, dizi doesn't want to get married! Dizi doesn't like that boy! Shifu must help dizi."

Duoluo Jing tried to comfort her, pointing to the river and saying, "Shengniang, do you still remember what we saw about water?" He then let out a helpless sigh, glancing at his father, who remained silent with closed eyes.

But this time, the lesson about water held no appeal for Ki Son-yeo; she returned to her master, whining more loudly. "Shifu, dizi truly doesn't want to. That Wang Jeong likes to bother girls; dizi doesn't like him at all."

Ki Son-yeo's strong objection reminded Duoluo Haoyu of Guo Jing's daughter, Guo Xiang, though with different problems and backgrounds. One of the most admired leaders of the Beggar's Sect (Kai Pang) for Duoluo Haoyu was Huang Rong herself, even though Huang Rong was reluctant to be the leader of Kai Pang. Indeed, after Huang Rong stepped down, Lu Youjiao died tragically without mastering the Dog Beating Staff properly, and then Yelu Qi did not succeed much in developing Kai Pang. At that time, Huang Rong's attention was firmly fixed on countering Kublai Khan's attack on Xiangyang, only assisting her husband.

Jinlun Fawang and Möngke Khan had died, but that did not mean Guo Xiang's personal problems were resolved. The girl never appeared in Xiangyang again, merely wandering alone, aimlessly, searching for something she already knew could never be achieved: marrying Yang Guo. She never even met Yang Guo again after they all parted ways at Huashan.

Vaguely, though not yet entirely clear, Duoluo Haoyu saw a path forward. He said calmly, "Believe me, for now, you won't be marrying anyone. Your qinggong is good enough, but your Yue Nu Jian Fa isn't yet. Shifu wants to see it again."

These words somewhat relieved Ki Son-yeo but confused Duoluo Jing. As Ki Son-yeo resumed practicing her sword techniques, he asked, "Father, why give the child false hope?"

His father opened his eyes, glanced at him briefly, then closed them again, saying, "You see it as false hope? I don't. Observe the child's practice."

---

The next day, Ki Ja-oh, while enjoying breakfast with his family, said with a beaming face, "Haha! Now Wang Ko's plan has naturally failed, after Huang Shang was assassinated!" He had never liked Wang Ko, who clearly harbored ambitions to seize the throne from King Chungsuk. His family was generally tired of hearing him curse Wang Ko's name at every breakfast.

His wife, Yi Haeng-gom, merely laughed to match his story, saying, "You mean Son-yeo will have a chance to become the empress later, right?"

All their much older sons, Ki Sik, Ki Ch'ol, Ki Won, Ki Chu, and Ki Yun, burst into laughter. Ki Ch'ol said, "Mother guessed correctly!"

However, hearing them mention her nickname, Ki Son-yeo furrowed her brow, saying sharply, "I don't want to marry that Wang Jeong!"

Immediately, the cheerful atmosphere was replaced by tension. All eyes stared at her, full of reprimand. Yi Haeng-gom glanced anxiously at her husband. This foolish child shouldn't say anything here, while they were eating, she thought.

Ki Sik asked, raising an eyebrow, "Do you want all of us to be executed?"

What was on Ki Son-yeo's mind at that moment was her master's 'promise': 'Believe me, for now, you won't be marrying anyone.' Then, 'Yue Nu Jian Fa', that sword art, the sword! She then said, imitating her master, "Believe me, I won't be marrying anyone right now." She smiled mysteriously, which her older brothers interpreted as defiance.

Their father cleared his throat. He deeply loved Ki Son-yeo, the youngest of them all. In this family, no one had ever scolded her. Without forcing or saying anything else that would displease his beloved daughter, he then diverted attention to his wife. "Haeng-gom, perhaps you should teach our child to play music and dance. This is important; it can calm the soul."

Smiling, his wife replied, "Oh, she's already begun learning a few weeks ago. Son-yeo, try playing that zither!"
