# Chapter 18
## *Wudang, September 15, 1366: Golden Blooms in Autumn*

Zhou Zhiruo and Yang Buhui worked together, preparing food to celebrate Zhao Min's birthday at Zhang Sanfeng's pavilion. As they carried the food and dining utensils to the spot, everyone present was startled by several secret weapons that swiftly flew past Yang Buhui's left shoulder, heading toward a heavily fruiting lychee tree.

Startled, Zhang Wuji instinctively leaped forward, blocking the sudden attack to protect the two women carrying trays full of food. Several third-generation Wudang disciples quickly placed the trays they were carrying onto the table, swords ready in hand. "Watch out!"

The hoarse voice of an old woman carried on the wind, seemingly filling the air around them. Zhang Wuji's and Yang Buhui's memories were transported back to their childhood, in Butterfly Valley.

Now, an almost identical scene repeated itself. Yang Buhui recognized the secret weapons, made of gold and shaped like flowers. Then, suddenly, as if appearing from behind the clouds, an old woman floated down with a very ugly-faced young girl. The old woman laughed with her hoarse voice. The girl was small, seemingly in her twenties, holding the old woman's left hand, landing softly on the ground, without a sound at all, indicating high-level qinggong.

Yang Buhui slowly began to realize that the girl was, of course, not young Yin Li, although her innocent and unrestrained demeanor felt exactly the same as she said to her grandmother, "*Popo*[^popo], they're all scared."

[^popo]: Popo (婆婆), "Grandma".

"Hmm, good," Jinhua Popo said happily. "That's how it should be."

"Jinhua Popo?" Yang Buhui exclaimed, almost disbelieving. She had heard all the stories from Zhang Wuji about their experiences on Snake Island. Xiao Zhao was previously her servant, but it turned out she was Jinhua Popo's daughter. But it was clear now that Xiao Zhao was already married to Zhang Wuji and even had two children. How was Jinhua Popo still the same as before? And who was that girl?

Zhang Wuji, of course, knew that the golden flower projectiles were not meant to harm anyone. He just smiled faintly, saying nothing.

"*Die*[^die], who is this grandma?" Alessandra asked. "Why does Aunt Yang call her Jinhua Popo?"

[^die]: Die (爹), "Father" or "Dad".

Smiling faintly, Zhao Min clasped her hands together, "Han Furen, how are you?"

Just as Zhou Zhiruo was about to greet her in the same manner, Rut suddenly ran up to Jinhua Popo, looking at her intently from close range, then laughed, asking, "*Laolao*, who are you?"

Very interested, Jinhua Popo then grabbed Rut by the collar behind her neck and lifted her high with just one hand, like lifting a kitten, bursting into laughter, and retorted, "Laolao? Hm! Aren't you afraid of me?"

At this moment, Rut was speaking more fluently, many of her utterances could be understood. She laughed happily again, touching Jinhua Popo's face, answering, "Why should I be afraid?"

Hearing that, Zhang Sanfeng, who had been silent until now, burst into hearty laughter. At that moment, 'Yin Li' said, "Popo, how about we take her to Snake Island?"

"Ah Li, do you like this child?" Jinhua Popo asked. "Or perhaps — you prefer *her father*?"

Suddenly, Ah Luo appeared from behind a tree, laughing heartily. "*Shijie*, that's enough, stop joking! Ah Li now has her own child." She turned to the girl mimicking Yin Li. "You too, don't confuse people."

Jinhua Popo and 'Yin Li' removed their disguises, laughing. The third-generation Wudang disciples looked astonished at their true faces and appearances. Dongfang Yuxian said, "Popo, they already know."

"Of course," Tajkis replied casually, turning to Zhang Wuji. "You dared to leave my daughter and grandchildren alone in Ningxia?"

Bowing respectfully with a smile, Zhang Wuji greeted, "*Yuemu*[^yuemu], how are you? Xiao Zhao isn't alone; there are many people there, and Ah Li also lives there."

[^yuemu]: Yuemu (岳母), "Mother in-law".

Zhao Min punched Dongfang Yuxian's shoulder, slightly annoyed. "You startled me!"

Having adventured with Yin Li in eradicating the officials infiltrated by Bolad Temur in Kaifeng, Dongfang Yuxian could naturally mimic her movements with ease. She just smiled faintly. "*Junzhu* must have known, it was only a matter of time."

The four disciples of Zhang Sanfeng only smiled faintly. They had indeed heard of Tajkis's dual role as Jinhua Popo and also the Purple-Robed Dragon King[^naga-berjubah-ungu] before. That issue was long in the past for them, and they themselves never had any personal problem with Tajkis.

[^naga-berjubah-ungu]: The Purple-Robed Dragon King was one of the Four Dharma Kings of the Ming Cult, whose true identity was Dai Qisi (戴綺絲), or Tajkis. She was Persian and married to Han Qianye (韓千葉), hence also known as Han Furen (韓夫人). Her daughter is Xiao Zhao.

Zhang Sanfeng himself had only heard stories from Zhang Wuji and his other disciples. After meeting Tajkis directly, he was quite impressed. This woman was not at all like the descriptions many people had given before. He could still understand why Tajkis had previously held a personal grudge against Hu Qingniu. Now, that matter was long past. Tajkis was now part of their own family, through Xiao Zhao's marriage to Zhang Wuji. Both before and now, there was no reason for Wudang to be hostile towards Tajkis.

Zhou Zhiruo was slightly troubled earlier, remembering her past ill-treatment of Yin Li, who was Tajkis's direct disciple. She still didn't know how to act, choosing to remain mostly silent.

In contrast, Zhang Wuji, without hesitation, said to their children, "This is also your grandmother — Mama Xiao's birth mother. Aren't you going to greet *Laolao*?"

Except for Rut, who was still watching Tajkis with intense curiosity, the other four children had been stunned since Tajkis revealed her disguise. They immediately saw Tajkis's resemblance to Xiao Zhao, though Tajkis's Persian features were far more pronounced. Alessandra quickly prompted her siblings to bow respectfully, "Laolao!"

"Laolao is very beautiful," Rut said, gently touching Tajkis's face with her small hand.

"Eh, you're also beautiful, like your grandmother," Tajkis said, handing Rut to Ah Luo, who was approaching them. "Ah Luo, this grandchild of yours inherited your courage." She then clasped her hands together to greet Zhang Sanfeng. "*Laonu*[^laonu] was merely joking. *Laonu* hope Zhang Zhenren doesn't mind a little entertainment."

[^laonu]: Laonu (老女), "This old woman".

"Aiyooo, your daughter advancing Ningxia, now that's entertainment for me," Zhang Sanfeng said happily. "You should go there; why are you still roaming in the south?"

"Laonu was shocked when disembarked in Quanzhou; a large-scale massacre was happening," Tajkis explained. "Then Laonu heard about some old acquaintances — ehm... in Jiangnan, this matter is a bit messed up... besides, Laonu also didn't know where to find that silly girl. Only knew she must have married this rascal son-in-law." She laughed freely. "When I arrived in Xiangyang, Laonu finally understood everything. *Shimei*, do you intend to be my rival or my friend now?" She turned to Ah Luo.

"What's the need for rivalry?" Ah Luo said, looking at Rut. "This grandchild of mine is also Shijie's grandchild. Likewise, Dario and Esther are also my grandchildren. All of this is actually the doing of Huang Shang and Zhang Zhenren, besides Shijie's own doing—who told you to go to Persia?"

Zhang Wuji cleared his throat. He felt that if he let them continue, his two mothers-in-law would start discussing things uncomfortable for him. "Yuemu, the Quanzhou issue has actually been partly relocated to Ningxia. Furthermore, Yuemu will surely be greatly needed there. It's just that right now, we must quickly get Aunt Qi out of the palace."

Tajkis laughed. "You truly believe Qi Shimei is crazy?"

Zhou Zhiruo felt a quiet joy within her. It turned out what she had thought before was starting to make sense. She cleared her throat, daring to speak, "It seems Mama feels the same way."

Previously, Tajkis had never liked Zhou Zhiruo. On Snake Island, when Zhou Zhiruo was her captive, she always judged Zhou Zhiruo's actions as suspicious. But now, the term 'Mama' that Zhou Zhiruo had just used felt somewhat sincere to her ears. Her heart began to soften. She smiled kindly, saying, "Qi Shimei has been very clever since childhood — or, more accurately, *cunning*. To me, she has never known hardship; she will surely find a way out of any problem. As soon as I heard about this matter, I felt she was currently playing the biggest *drama* of her life. I'm just not sure what her intention is."

For Zhang Sanfeng, this was something new. He had never considered this possibility at all.

With furrowed brows, Ah Luo said, "To me, there's only one reason for Qi Shimei to do something like that—to force Huang Shang to retreat north. But earlier, she said 'don't touch Ningxia,' which Wang Baobao himself heard! This means she wants to retreat to another place. I think Ding Minjun's action of going to Shangdu was correct. Somehow, this aligns with Qi Shimei's thinking."

"Ding Minjun?" Tajkis's brows furrowed, then she burst into laughter. "You mean Miejue's insolent disciple?" Her laughter grew louder. "I slapped her many times. I think Miejue would surely approve of my actions. But from your account, it seems Qi Shimei managed to conquer that child. Ah Luo, I think the only way to resolve this is for us to enter the palace and take control from within. I believe Huang Shang will listen to Wuji now! That way, we can also bring Qi Shimei out of there."

Hearing "enter the palace," Matteo and Francesco immediately grew interested. Hopeful, Francesco asked, "Laolao can enter the palace?"

"Why not? Your father certainly can too! But if entering the *harem*, I'm the one who can do it," Tajkis explained. "Ah Luo, aren't you actually able to go back in there too?"

"Yes, but I was afraid of messing up Qi Shimei's plan," Ah Luo explained. "After that, I became uncertain if I could leave freely again, because Huang Shang would surely forbid me from going."

For Alessandra, this was new. They had never understood that their father would have difficulty entering the palace harem. She asked, "Laolao, why can't Father enter the harem?"

"Because only eunuchs or women can do it," Tajkis said. "Only Huang Shang himself, a man, can enter the harem."

This was precisely what Zhang Wuji had been thinking earlier, which was why he hadn't said anything about how to free Qi Shengniang. Now Tajkis added a new possibility, that Qi Shengniang was deliberately feigning insanity. His mind began to race, exploring new possibilities to hasten the resolution of the problem.

Zhang Sanfeng suddenly asked, "Wuji, are you brave enough to *take over* the palace now?"

Zhang Wuji currently felt the same way he did years ago when they first set out from Wudang Shan, when he had just become the Ming Cult leader, Xiao Zhao was only about fifteen, and Zhao Min challenged Wudang, no older than twelve. If back then he was bold because he hadn't yet realized the consequences of his actions, now he was facing those consequences. He had to finish what he started, and at the same time, mend the damage done. Speaking of mistakes, he had indeed made too many. Now, his two wives were here, and his two mothers-in-law were ready to help him. What did he have to fear?

"If Yuemu (Mother-in-law) dares, why wouldn't Wuji?" he said, turning to Ah Luo. "I think Yuemu should also return to the palace now. We'll still help Huang Shang overcome his difficulties, even if we eventually leave him."

Yin Liting felt amused inwardly; his nephew had so many 'Yuemu' present at once. If Li Furen were also here, he might get confused on how to differentiate the calls. Only Zhou Zhiruo's mother had passed away. No wonder Zhou Zhiruo now considered Li Furen and Qi Shengniang as her own mothers. Suddenly, an idea sparked in his mind, envisioning what Qi Shengniang had once proposed. He said, "Wuji, why just your mothers-in-law? I think you can take all these children into that chaotic palace. Isn't Yi An truly Huang Shang's grandchild? If you yourself can't freely enter and exit the harem, couldn't they?"

Everyone responded to his suggestion with excitement. Alessandra immediately tugged at Zhang Wuji's sleeve, "Die (Dad), that's right! Take all of us!"

Zhou Zhiruo glanced at Zhao Min, full of questions. They highly doubted whether Yin Liting's suggestion could be implemented. But then Ah Luo said, "You can stay in my room, but don't just wander out to other places. You all definitely need to learn about palace rules first. This will take time, because in the palace, we can't speak carelessly."

Hearing this, Matteo and Francesco's eyes sparkled. Francesco asked hopefully, "Laolao, can we really go into the palace?"

Rut, influenced by her older siblings' excitement, clapped her hands without understanding what was happening, saying, "Laolao, Tai Sh-sh-Yeye can come too? Yi An can come?"

But Avraham murmured, "But *Allah* didn't order father to be emperor..."

Laughing, Zhang Sanfeng sat Rut on his lap, while Zhang Wuji looked at Avraham seriously, saying, "Father won't be emperor; he just wants to help the emperor there. Do you think *Allah* would permit that?"

During his stay in Xiangyang, Avraham often heard Sara and Alya's family stories about Joseph helping Pharaoh in Egypt. This story greatly influenced him. He immediately cheered, "Then *Allah* will surely permit it!"

But Zhao Min was still doubtful, muttering, "How can we enter the palace with so many people...?"

Ah Luo said calmly, "You'd be surprised." Without hesitation, she turned to Dongfang Yuxian. "Yuxian, you also have to come this time. We'll enter the palace and take control of it, then leave after it's done. Let the demons who want power sit there."

## *October 1366: Journey to the Palace*

After over half a month of preparation, teaching everyone the most basic palace rules and etiquette, Ah Luo felt they could begin the long journey to Dadu.

The small entourage still had to travel by carriage, considering they were bringing Rut, who was still very young. But the atmosphere along the way felt more relaxed. They could still joke and laugh to ease the tension caused by the widespread war. Avoiding Li Siqi's territory, they headed slightly east, passed through Nanyang, then stopped in Xuchang, and continued east of Kaifeng.

On the outskirts of a pine forest, a few li outside Kaifeng's eastern gate, Zhang Wuji saw Elbeg and some of his subordinates on patrol. He then gave orders, "Send someone to Shangdu, deliver my command to Fan Youshi. Send Shaoli Junzhu and her son to Shangdu. They must accompany the Taizi's (Crown Prince's) family there. For now, both the Taizi and Wang Gongzi will remain in Dadu and Henan, but this way they will be safe."

Elbeg immediately assented, but then asked, "Jiaozhu (Cult Leader), what about Henan?"

Zhang Wuji smiled faintly, saying, "Isn't Wang Gongzi still the King of Henan? Let it remain so."

Zhao Min asked, "Any news from Murong Bing?"

"Oh?" Elbeg said, smiling. "They're marching towards Suzhou."

"Good," Zhou Zhiruo said. "Tell Zeng Zhanglao's subordinates to follow us along the way. We need to send news everywhere."

Swiftly, using the writing materials in the carriage, Zhou Zhiruo penned a short letter to Ma Xiuying, containing only a single line: "Please ensure the safety of Han Lin'er." She signed the letter with her own name and Zhao Min's. Handing the letter to Elbeg, she said curtly, "Send it immediately to Yingtian!"

Continuing their journey, they stopped in Qufu, Shandong, celebrating Matteo and Francesco's birthday near the residence of the Confucius family, which seemed to be somewhat affected by the numerous bandits roaming, taking advantage of the wartime chaos.

At an inn, Alessandra overheard a group of middle-aged men discussing bandit disturbances in their village, not far from the place.

Hearing Alessandra's report, Zhang Wuji's brows furrowed. The Confucius family were nobles highly respected by all factions. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, this area received major renovations to restore its grandeur and show the imperial family's respect for Confucius and his teachings. Now, bandits from the south dared to cause trouble here?

He turned to Tajkis, who seemed to be contemplating her own plan with a mysterious smile. "Yuemu (Mother-in-law) has a plan to deal with these people?"

Looking at Ah Luo, Tajkis grinned widely, saying, "Now Jinhua Popo must reappear. Wasn't Ah Li only Alessandra's age back then? It's time these children got some real training!" Shifting her gaze to Avraham, Matteo, and Francesco, she asked, "How about we have a little fun? Ziyang, prepare plenty of your arrows!"

Zhang Wuji was very surprised, asking, "Yuemu, no arrows allowed! Those can still kill people!"

Understanding Tajkis's intent, Ah Luo just laughed, saying, "You three (Zhang Wuji, Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo) don't worry, stay here with Rut. We won't cut off people's ears like Mei Jian, much less kill them. But I think shooting bandits in the rear is harmless."

Grinning widely, Avraham felt his bow, ensuring it was still leaning against his back, saying, "Shooting behinds is easier than lychees."

Full of excitement, Matteo said, "Laolao, let's go!"

---

The village in question was located about five li outside the city of Qufu. Since the era when Guo Jing lived, there were actually two descendants of Confucius holding the title of 'Yansheng Gong', due to animosity towards the Jurchen tribe. At that time, Kong Duanyou, who held the Yansheng Gong title, fled south with the future Emperor Gaozong and settled in Zhejiang, while the newly formed Jin Dynasty in the north appointed his younger brother, Kong Duancao, as Yansheng Gong in Qufu.

From then on, until the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty, there were two Yansheng Gongs, in Qufu and Quzhou. Kublai Khan later invited the southern Yansheng Gong, Kong Zhu, to return to Qufu. However, the invitation was refused, and so the title was withdrawn from the southern branch of the Confucius family. Only the northern family held this title. Nevertheless, the southern branch of the family still exists to this day.

This hatred for the Yuan Dynasty was a continuation of previous hatred for the Jin Dynasty, and they felt no guilt plundering goods around the area. Currently, a group of plunderers were transporting their loot using carts, which they had also forcibly taken from local people, towards another neighboring village.

In the middle of the road, suddenly three secret weapons swiftly flew, piercing the hindquarters of the horses pulling the carts. The horses neighed in pain, leaping forward in surprise, then abruptly stopped a few meters before hitting a tree. From atop that tree, the hoarse voice of an old woman in a purple robe burst into boisterous laughter, gracefully descending from the tree. Beside her, a small girl followed lightly. Both landed soundlessly on the cart. The old woman said hoarsely, "You dare to rob in the territory of Kongzi's family!"

Some of the individuals involved were indeed members of the Hongjin Qiyi (Red Turban Uprising), recognizing the old woman, and shouted, "Jinhua Popo!"

Others were surprised and confused at the same time, "Zi Shan Longwang!"[^zi-shan-longwang]

[^zi-shan-longwang]: Zi Shan Longwang (紫衫龍王), "Purple-Robed Dragon King."

"Jinhua Popo is actually Zi Shan Longwang?"

Tajkis had never worn her purple robe when disguised as Jinhua Popo, but now she intentionally wore it to intimidate the Red Turban followers.

One of the bandits successfully recruited by Hongjin Qiyi stepped forward, pointing his finger at Tajkis, shouting loudly, "You Ming Jiao traitor, still dare to show your face here?"

"Heh?" Tajkis said, turning to the little girl beside her, "Ah Li, this person never rinses his mouth; it stinks! What do you think?"

The girl giggled. "Popo wants to slap him?"

Hearing her way of speaking, the bandit was deeply offended. "Hey, you stinky brat! Your grandpa here will slap you! If you dare..."

His sentence was unfinished. The little girl darted down from the cart. Her movements were as fast as wind, her small figure transforming into a blurry blue shadow. In an instant, 'Plok! Plok!' both the bandit's cheeks were slapped squarely, near his lips. The girl swiftly glided back to her grandmother's side, using her opponent's head as a stepping stone to jump. She stood with hands on hips, laughing. "Popo, was that right or not?"

"Not bad," Jinhua Popo replied, chuckling. "You should have been able to do it five times."

Alessandra, now taking on the role of 'Yin Li' from Dongfang Yuxian, genuinely felt curious this time. She thought she was quite fast managing to slap her opponent twice, but her grandmother lightly dismissed it as merely "passable," suggesting she should have done more. "Popo (Grandma), Dizi (disciple/granddaughter) doesn't know how."

"Now, watch carefully," Jinhua Popo said. Without warning, she moved far faster than her granddaughter. Everyone only saw a purple blur as she used her wrist movements to slap both sides of the same person's cheeks ten times. Before the man could even react in anger, she was back in her original spot, using another bandit's head as a stepping stone.

'Yin Li' burst into boisterous laughter. Jinhua Popo asked in a flat tone, "Ah Li, too much joking won't improve your kung fu. Is it clear now?"

"Popo used her wrist; of course, it's faster," Alessandra said.

The group of bandits was enraged, all drawing their machetes and beginning to shout, "Friends, these traitors dare to insult us! Insulting us is insulting Jiaozhu (Cult Leader)! Kill them!"

His sentence had just finished when an arrow flew swiftly from the right, piercing his right buttock an inch deep. No one saw where the arrow came from. The bandit wearing the red headband screamed in pain, clutching his rear, pointing his finger at Alessandra, "You stinky brat, you're using demonic arts!"

Without waiting for another command, his companions charged toward Tajkis and Alessandra, who were still standing on the cart.

The bandit's sentence had just finished when an arrow flew swiftly from the right, piercing his right buttock an inch deep. No one saw where the arrow came from. The bandit wearing the red headband screamed in pain, clutching his rear, pointing his finger at Alessandra, "You stinky brat, you're using demonic arts!"

Without waiting for another command, his companions charged toward Tajkis and Alessandra, who were still standing on the cart.

Facing the charge of about fifty men, Tajkis seemed even more delighted. Giving Alessandra a hand signal, she moved quickly to the right side, while Alessandra moved to the left, drawing her wooden sword.

Suddenly, from the left rear, two young boys, about seven years old, approached them, riding two small Mongolian horses, quickly leaping from their horses while drawing long wooden swords. Their movements were very fast, just like when the girl on the cart slapped her opponent's cheek. In a short time, five Red Turban soldiers mixed with bandits felt their buttocks pierced by something very sharp. Screaming in pain, they then realized their behinds had been wounded by the wooden sword thrusts. Then, successively, more than ten people on the left side of the cart experienced the same due to Alessandra's actions. They all heard the girl whisper as she passed them with her wooden sword, "*Jiaozhu is my father*, how could I insult him?"

From the right side, several others screamed in pain after golden flowers and arrows pierced their buttocks. In less than five minutes, all fifty men were lying on the ground. Jinhua Popo had pressure-pointed them with the tip of her staff.

Now Jinhua Popo stood before them, saying in a hoarse voice, "Don't let me see you in Shandong again. Quickly, get out of here before my patience runs out!"

Ah Luo jumped down from a tree to the west, carrying Avraham. Matteo and Francesco burst into laughter, high-fiving each other. "Not bad! Laolao, what about these goods?"

"Deliver everything to the Village Chief's house," Tajkis replied.


## *Dadu, November 1366: The Arrival of Princess Yi An*

Only Ah Luo herself entered through the palace gate, holding Rut's hand, greeting the guards at the entrance warmly. The guards felt no need to ask for identification. "Niangniang, we didn't see Niangniang leave."

They were indeed completely unaware that Ah Luo had left the palace. She wasn't a top-tier concubine, and no one had noticed her departure. It was not at all surprising to her that this guard was confused. "Just picking up my granddaughter from Xiangyang," Ah Luo replied casually.

Now, several guards present were even more bewildered. They didn't know that Ah Luo now had a granddaughter.

Rut observed the surroundings with intense curiosity. The presence of so many armed guards in the palace didn't frighten her in the slightest. She walked beside Ah Luo, chattering cheerfully. They turned several corners, greeting many eunuchs and servants, before arriving at the library.

As before, when she had brought Yin Li out from here, Ah Luo once again exerted her inner energy to slide aside a heavy bookshelf, revealing a hidden opening behind it. She peeked inside and said, "Come out!"

One after another, Tajkis, Dongfang Yuxian, Alessandra, and her three other siblings emerged from within. Finally, Zhang Wuji and his two wives came out of the same opening. Then Ah Luo closed the opening again with the bookshelf.

"Wow! What room is this?" Zhao Min asked.

"The library," Ah Luo said, looking around them. "In this small room, we usually read and write. Far from the political affairs outside. You all wait here. I will prepare a safe place for all of you. Yuxian, you can disguise yourself as a servant; there's a set of our servant clothes on that second shelf. I'll take Rut with Yuxian. We will go to see Huang Shang (Emperor)."

Without wasting time, after Dongfang Yuxian changed clothes, the three of them left the large library. Not long after, a small eunuch arrived with several servants, bringing snacks, fruits, and drinks for them.

"Niangniang told us to deliver these," the eunuch said curtly.

They received no other explanation.

---

Eunuch He announced from outside the Assembly Hall in his loud, clear voice, "Luo Cairen (Lady Luo) requests an audience!"

All eyes turned to Ah Luo and Dongfang Yuxian as they entered the hall, leading Rut. The child looked at the people around her, giggling and smiling widely. "Laolao (Grandma), their outfits are funny."

"Shhh..." Dongfang Yuxian put a finger to her lips.

Kneeling before Toghon Temur's throne, Ah Luo greeted briefly, "Chenqie (Your humble concubine) pays respects to Huang Shang!"

Toghon Temur's previously gloomy eyes immediately brightened, gazing at Rut who was looking back at him fearlessly, grinning widely, showing off her nearly complete set of teeth. This child's eyes and brows, her expression, and her gestures clearly showed she was Ah Xiu's daughter! He wondered inwardly why Ah Xiu hadn't come, and why Ah Luo was only now reappearing in the palace.

Rising from his throne, Toghon Temur helped Ah Luo stand up, then immediately lifted Rut high in delight, completely ignoring the gazes of the Assembly members. "Aiyo! You're already this big? Why have you never come to the palace?"

Rut clapped her hands gleefully, then stroked Emperor Toghon Temur's beard and sideburns, which piqued her curiosity, cheerfully greeting, "Yeye (Grandpa)!"

That address made some Assembly members' eyebrows rise. The address did not contain the word 'Huang' (Imperial), which they considered mandatory for all imperial grandchildren! Their gazes immediately turned to Ah Luo, full of criticism. Inwardly, several people thought, "That Cainu[^cainu]... they really don't know any etiquette!"

[^cainu]: Cainu (採女) was a low-ranking concubine. In fact, the ranking system for women in the Yuan Dynasty harem was the simplest of all other dynasties. Basically, there were only Huanghou (Empress), Shufei (Consort), and Pin (Consort), but some terms from the Song Dynasty were still used by some people to further categorize these women, in their own view. Ah Luo had deliberately placed herself in the lowest rank.

Correcting the address without causing a commotion, Toghon said, "Huang Yeye (Imperial Grandfather) is busy; do you want to help Huang Yeye?"

Rut nodded her head, asking, "Can I?"

Toghon laughed happily, carrying the child to his throne, placing Rut right beside him. "Of course, you can! Who dares to object?"

Several people behind Ah Luo and Dongfang Yuxian cleared their throats, others coughed, their whispers only partly caught: "This is out of line..." "What does this Cainu want...?"

Ah Luo laughed inwardly. The people behind her must have been looking at the child suspiciously, each with their own thoughts.

Dadu, December 1366: The Plan Takes Shape
Next, Toghon Temur said, "Ah Luo, sit to the right of Munashiri, and have your servant wait outside!"

Ah Luo saw Empress Munashiri sitting uncomfortably, seemingly unused to the critical gazes of the Assembly members. She had never attended such an event before. It appeared Toghon Temur had deliberately brought her to replace Qi Shengniang, though Ah Luo knew this move wouldn't work.

After Dongfang Yuxian exited and Ah Luo was comfortably seated, Toghon said, "Now, what were you all saying?"

He Shuo rose from his seat, bowed, and calmly said, "Bixia (Your Imperial Majesty), your servant believes that if we continue to allow the pressure in the south, sooner or later one of them will move north."

"So what do you want to do?" Toghon Temur asked.

"Wang Baobao—ehm, your servant means Koke Temur—can be sent to reinforce Chen Youding's defenses in Fujian," He Shuo said, without raising his head.

"Nonsense!" Toghon Temur exclaimed, rapping the table with a metal plate. "Why not Li Siqi? I actually want to bring Koke Temur to Dadu! Li Siqi and his gang aren't helping; they're just messing up Henan!"

"Bixia, if Li Siqi moves south, who will oversee Shaanxi?"

"It's the same! If Koke Temur goes south, Li Siqi will immediately seize Henan and then attack me from the north!" Toghon snapped angrily. "He Shuo, you're not unaware of this."

At that moment, Ayushiridara, seated two columns to the right of the Assembly, seemed about to say something, but Toghon silenced him with a hand gesture, turning back to his Assembly with a bored tone. "No need to prolong this. I'm tired. We'll continue tomorrow!"

He smiled as he took Rut's hand, turned, and left the room, followed by his entourage of eunuchs.

After he left, the Assembly members slowly dispersed, continuing to whisper among themselves. Munashiri approached Ah Luo, whispering, "Qi Huanghou is very bad; we don't know how to deal with her anymore..."

"We'll talk about this later," Ah Luo whispered back. "Let's go straight to your room."

Ayushiridara also approached, but before he could speak, Ah Luo said, "Go to the library immediately. Bring those children and their father to your room."

"Children?" Ayushiridara was surprised.

"Don't ask so many questions, just do it," Ah Luo said. "We'll meet in Huang Shang's private room. Tell their mothers to go to the harem. Your aunt—Tajkis—is also there."

Ningxia, December 1366: A Father's Wish
While changes, barely noticed by the residents of Ningxia, were taking place in the local government, Ah Xiu's pregnancy had entered its sixth month. They received an unexpected letter from the palace, written by Emperor Toghon Temur himself, in Han Chinese. It was clear Toghon Temur had been overjoyed since Rut's arrival. This was clearly reflected in the letter's content.

Greatly surprised, Ah Xiu's brows furrowed unhappily, muttering, "Rut was taken to the palace? Won't this complicate things for all of us later...? Who had such an idea...?"

Xiao Zhao also read the letters while breastfeeding Esther, saying more calmly, "Dajie (Elder Sister), take a look. Mama is there too! I never expected Mama to return to Zhongyuan, let alone go to the palace!"

There were indeed several letters. Ah Xiu had only read her father's writing, while Xiao Zhao read her mother's and Ah Luo's. Ah Xiu quickly read through them and found what Xiao Zhao had said. "My goodness! They all went to the palace!"

"What did Huang Shang say next?" Xiao Zhao asked. She was reading Zhang Wuji's writing but wanted to know Toghon Temur's wishes.

Ah Xiu was stunned, still holding her father's letter, but a faint smile gradually spread across her lips. "Fuhuang (Imperial Father) wishes that this child be baptized by the Latin Church. If it's a boy, he must be named Giovanni; if it's a girl, we can choose our own name."

Feeling rather amused, remembering the rivalry between Father Niccolo and Father Li Jinming from the Eastern Church, Xiao Zhao said with a laugh, "Perhaps this time it's Li Jinming's turn to be honored with naming the child."

Ah Xiu grew suspicious, as Li Jinming liked to invent funny names. "What name do you think Li Jinming would give?"

Xiao Zhao laughed. "Don't worry; if you want, from now on, we can talk more often about the ancient figures we prefer if it's a girl. Jacob and Esau's birth mother, known in Persian as Rivka, her name is quite sweet. Or Jacob's beloved wife's name, Raheel. So our children are a bit funny. I was baptized in the Latin Church, but Esther in the Eastern Church. Now, whether this Giovanni or Rivka, they will be baptized in the Latin Church, even though you yourself are a member of the Eastern Church."
